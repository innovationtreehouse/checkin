/**
 * Test doubles for the Shopify GraphQL surface.
 *
 * `fakeClient` is a `ShopifyClient` whose `request` is driven by a responder you
 * supply, while recording every `{ query, variables }` it was called with so a test
 * can assert the exact filter / cursor / page size that the code under test sent.
 * The real client's retry/throttle loop is exercised separately in
 * client-request.test.ts against a stubbed global `fetch`; here we stub the whole
 * client so orchestration tests stay free of network and timing concerns.
