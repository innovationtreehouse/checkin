/**
 * Minimal PrismaClient double for unit tests. Only the delegate methods the code

 * silently no-op'ing. Core functions that take prisma (ingestNode, withSyncRun, …)
 * are mocked at the module boundary in the tests that need them, so this only has to
 * satisfy the few direct `prisma.*` calls in the read-path code (e.g. store.upsert).
