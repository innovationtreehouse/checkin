# Expense + QuickBooks: porting `expense-app` into checkin

## Problem

The organization turns hundreds of corporate-card receipts a year into booked
QuickBooks entries: each receipt's money side is split into line items, each line
is signed off by whoever owns that budget, capital purchases get a fixed-asset
number, and the whole thing is posted to QuickBooks against the right account.
Today that lives in a separate application, on separate infrastructure, behind
its own login, that the organization is retiring — and it is the **money-side
tail of the receipt→catalog→inventory pipeline**, the point where a received
receipt finally becomes a general-ledger fact. Finance staff cannot run any of it
where they already work (checkin), and — critically — **checkin has no
QuickBooks integration at all** (no QB model, field, client, or credential
anywhere in schema or `src`; confirmed in `docs/backlog/CUJS.md` A15). So this
port also has to bring the first QuickBooks code into checkin.

## Objective

Expense capture, per-line owner approval, the finance flag/checkoff queues, the
capital register, and QuickBooks posting are available inside the existing staff
application as ordinary navigation, under the same sign-in and look and feel,
deployed and operated as one system — with the expense logic kept cleanly
separable (its own library, its own database), the pipeline couplings (receipt in,
catalog lookups, inventory load out) designed as explicit swappable seams, and
QuickBooks brought in as an **incremental phase ladder** grounded in the real
`@inventory/quickbooks` client rather than a stub.

## Executive summary

- **Finance staff** reach expense as a new finance area in the existing nav;
  checkoffs and holds route to a new `FINANCE` role and (for escalations) the
  existing `BOARD` role, per-line approval routes to the line's **budget owner**,
  and — unlike the catalog/inventory ports — **reads are narrow, not broad**:
  expense data is financially sensitive, so there is no wide viewer gate (§6).
- **Operators** get one application to run and deploy — no second service, no
  second login — with expense on its own database on the shared server, and one
  new operational step: a **one-time QuickBooks OAuth consent** to mint tokens
  (§9).
- **Developers** get expense as an isolated library (`@inventory/expense`): logic,
  data, and screens in one package; checkin only wires it in. QuickBooks arrives
  as the shared `@inventory/quickbooks` package — read client + OAuth already
  built, the write path and checkin token storage net-new (§9).
- **The organization** gets the pipeline's money terminus moved onto the seam the
  catalog and inventory ports established, plus the **first QuickBooks connection**
  — settled once, reused by donations and program-finance later (GC-QB).

**Issue:** [#1272](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1272)
— backlog epic **FE** (§6 of `docs/backlog/INDEX.md`), anchor item **FE1**.
Journey **A13** in `docs/backlog/CUJS.md`. The epic's other issues —
[#1273](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1273) (FE2 budget
owners / owner conflict),
[#1274](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1274) (FE3 QB

(FE6–FE8) — are referenced **without any closing keyword**: this is a design-doc
PR, and a closing link here would auto-close them on merge with nothing built.
Relates to **RB2 "Role: Finance"**
([#1314](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1314), open,
readiness DECISION) — the canonical backlog issue for the finance role this port
stands up (§6); referenced **without a closing keyword** and left open (the port
partially addresses it with the interim `FINANCE` role; the label/scope decision
stays #1314's, exactly as #1286 relates to RB4/#1316).

**Status:** design. No board decision gates the mechanics below. This doc is the
**third in a series** and **reuses the base architecture** established by the
global-catalog design
([#1286](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1286),
`docs/in-design/1286_GLOBAL_CATALOG_INTEGRATION.md`) and the local-inventory
design
([#1287](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1287),
`docs/in-design/1287_LOCAL_INVENTORY_INTEGRATION.md`) — **read those two first.**
Everything about in-process packaging, the own-database topology, the security
regime over a separate schema, the retire-source-auth decision, the injected
`Org` registry, and the per-crossing coupling rule is carried over verbatim from
them; this doc states the expense-specific surface, the finance role/read
divergence, and the QuickBooks phase ladder that is unique to it.

**Source:** `expense-app/` in the `innovationtreehouse/Inventory` repo (a separate
repo — not vendored here). Not currently deployed in Infra.
**QuickBooks client:** `packages/quickbooks/` (`@inventory/quickbooks`) in the same
monorepo — a working read-only QBO client (OAuth2 in three `fetch` calls, no SDK),
**not a stub** (§9).

**Domain rules relied on:** `docs/backlog/TOPDOWN.md` **GC-FIN-CONTROL**
(flags + checkoff + audit — the app surfaces flags for human checkoff, it does
**not** enforce approval tiers), **GC-PROGRAM-FINANCE** and **GC-QB** (settle the
QB connection/auth first); `docs/rules/principles.md` (least-privilege — here it
*narrows* reads, §6); the security-boundary and migration-order rules cited inline
in §5, §9, and the QB token handling in §9.

## 1. Goal and shape

Bring expense into checkin as **more nav items in the existing checkin app — one
Next.js process, one Infra deploy** — not a second service. Identical to the
catalog (#1286 §1) and inventory (#1287 §1) decisions.

**The whole app — domain *and* UI — lands as an isolated library package**
(`@inventory/expense`): repositories, services, the xstate expense state machine,
the QB processor, the capital register, Prisma schema/client, and every React
component, page, and route handler. `checkin-app` holds **only structural wiring,
no expense logic**: filesystem-routing re-export stubs, one `configureExpense()`
boot call that injects checkin's auth + DB + org + the crossing adapters, a nav
splice, and the security-registry entries (§5). The dependency arrow points one
way — **the library never imports checkin; checkin injects into the library.**

This is the **third app of the whole-Inventory migration** (catalog first,
inventory second). Expense sits **downstream of receipt-app** (it consumes the
receipt money side) and **couples sideways to the catalog** (item/account lookups)
and **to local-inventory** (signoff triggers inventory load). Where expense
touches Inventory apps that have not moved yet (receipt-app, the
workflow-mapping orchestrator), we **keep the HTTP seam / bring temporary copies**
exactly as #1286 §8 prescribes — temporary meaning **< 2 weeks, dev-only, never
in a release** — with a clean port at each crossing (§8).

The one thing this port adds that neither predecessor had: **QuickBooks**. It
lands `@inventory/quickbooks` as the first QB code in checkin and grows the write
path on an explicit phase ladder (§9).

### Decisions locked (carried over from #1286/#1287, adapted)

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| DB topology | **Own dedicated database** (`EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL`) on the **same Postgres server** — separate `schema.prisma` + own Prisma client + own migrations. Same `@inventory/monitoring-db` precedent #1286 followed. |
| Security regime | **Adopt checkin's** registry + `@sensitivity` generator + stripper + scopeBindings over the separate schema (§5). QBO tokens are the first `secret`-tier data the Inventory suite carries. |
| Auth | **Retire** `expense-app`'s `@inventory/auth` + `@inventory/web-auth` (+ `jose`, the login page, `/api/auth/{login,logout}`). checkin next-auth session is the only auth (§6). |
| Roles | **New `FINANCE` role** (RB2 "Finance" umbrella — a role `docs/backlog/TOPDOWN.md` GC-ROLES explicitly *keeps*, not a net-new invention) for the checkoff/queue actor; **existing `BOARD`** for threshold/COI escalation; per-line approval routes to the line's **budget owner** (a `Person`, a data relationship not an RBAC role). **Reads narrow** — no broad viewer gate (§6). This is the port's main divergence from #1286/#1287. |
| Scope | **Full port** of the A13 / FE1–FE5 surface (§ below), with temporary shims at the not-yet-migrated receipt-app / orchestrator boundaries (§8). FE6–FE8 noted, not designed (§9, §12). |
| UI location | **All UI in the library** — components, pages, route handlers. checkin-app only re-exports and mounts (§3). |
| UI style | **Keep the client pattern** — `"use client"` pages + `/api/*` routes; re-auth + re-theme only. Matches checkin's dominant pattern, same as #1286 §7 / #1287 §7. |
| `orgId` / user identity | **Keep the columns; inject the values** — resolved by #1286 §6. Org identity comes from the **checkin-owned `Org` registry table** (seeded on the initial migration with a stable well-known id), injected as an accessor `getOrg(): OrgIdentity` — **not** an env scalar, **not** a `SettingsData` row, **not** a cross-DB read. The heavy user-id columns (`submitterId`, `ownerId`, `budgetOwnerUserId`, `decidedByUserId`, `capitalOwnerId`, `userId`) map to checkin **`Person.id`** via the injected principal. Both flow through the single `configureExpense()` injection (§6). |
| QuickBooks | **Incremental phase ladder** QB-0…QB-3 (§9), grounded in `@inventory/quickbooks` (read client + OAuth already built; write path + checkin token storage + the `qb_pending` terminus net-new). Tokens stored `secret`-tier in the DB, never a gitignored file. |

### The A13 / FE1–FE5 surface (scope)

1. **Expense + line model; per-line owner approval** (FE1). Each line gets a
   `LineItemOwnerApproval`; the budget owner approves/rejects their own lines.
2. **Approval + flag / checkoff / audit** (FE1/FE2, GC-FIN-CONTROL). Flags —
   tax-attached, threshold-crossed, missing-receipt, non-Everyday, **COI/conflict**
   — are surfaced to the right human (finance / board) for a checkoff, all
   audit-logged. The app does **not** enforce approval tiers; the **household-aware
   COI conflict flag is the one with real logic** and is *buildable here* because
   checkin has households (§6, the "port gets better" item). Actions:
   approve / reject / assign-owner / finance-assign / raise-exception /
   resolve-unknown, each with its queue.
3. **Budget owners; owner↔PN associations; owner-conflict resolution** (FE2).
   `PartOwnerMap` (owner per GTIN) + the owner-conflict resolution queue.
4. **Capital review + depreciation-cycle designation** (FE4), including the
   **capital-register seed intake** the QB script feeds (§8, §9 QB-1), and the
   NET-NEW loop-closing step (assign ITFA number → log in QB → remind finance to
   sticker the physical asset, Q66).
5. **Expense holds + resubmit; MULTIPLE_MATCHES hold** (FE3). The account-mapping
   exception screen: `NO_MATCH` / `MULTIPLE_MATCHES` / `NO_PART_NUMBER` holds,
   resolve + resubmit.

Each surface has its own **exception/queue screen** — those queues are the
"missed oversight surfaces" A13 is about.

## 2. What the source is

`expense-app` is a Next 16 / React 19 / Mantine 7 / Prisma 7 app — the **same
stack checkin already runs**, and the same stack as the two prior ports. Cleanly
layered:

```
src/
  repositories/   expense, org, orgEvents, provisionalItemMap, provisionalResolution   (Prisma access)
  services/       provisionalItemMapService                                            (domain logic)
  workflows/      expense.machine + events/guards/invariants + expense-event-schema     (xstate lifecycle; QbLineItemSchema)
  lib/            expense-qb-processor, expense-rules, financial-flow, capital-register,
                  workflow-engine, expense-constants, catalog-schemas          (domain; portable)
                  inventory-client, api-client, org-events-poller, org-events-container (crossings)
                  auth, auth-shared, route-auth                                (RETIRE — see §6)
  app/api/…       route handlers (thin: guard → validate → service → response)
  app/…           page.tsx (client) per surface
  components/      AppShellLayout, CapitalReviewPanel, LineItemOwnerApprovals, … (reskin/retire)
prisma/schema.prisma  16 models (own migrations)
```

**Prisma models** (own schema, `@@map` to snake_case): `Expense`,
`ExpenseLineItem`, `LineItemOwnerApproval`, `AccountMapping`, `ExpenseHold`,
`ExpenseEvent` (the **QB outbox**), `ExpenseQbAccount`, `ExpenseAuditLog`,
`PartOwnerMap`, `ProvisionalItemMap`, `ProvisionalResolution`,
`ReceivedExpensePayload` (receipt intake), `ReceivedOrgEvent`, `CapitalAsset`
(the **ITFA fixed-asset register**), `OrgSettings` (capital thresholds),
`SettingsData` (poll config — dead on arrival, §8).

The domain layer is framework-light and ports almost verbatim. The friction is
**auth wiring, the QuickBooks terminus, and the three pipeline couplings** (§8/§9),
not the domain. Two mechanisms worth flagging up front because the port must
preserve them exactly:

- **The QB "post" is an outbox emit, not a direct API call.** The state machine
  runs `owner_approval → (capital_review → set_depreciation_cycle) → qb_pending`,
  and at `qb_pending` `expense-qb-processor.ts` resolves each line to one QB
  account, allocates tax/shipping/discount, and — in **one interactive
  transaction** — writes a validated `QbExpenseEvent` row to the `ExpenseEvent`
  table and advances `qb_pending → qb_complete`. The row is the durable outbox;
  **something downstream posts it to QuickBooks.** In the source that downstream
  writer does not exist yet — the machine terminates the moment the event is
  committed. **The write path is exactly what §9 QB-2 builds** in
  `@inventory/quickbooks`.
- **`backfill` / `qb_skipped`.** An expense reconciled to an already-booked QB
  transaction auto-approves owner signoff and lands terminal `qb_skipped` (QB post
  skipped) while still building the capital register. This is the hook for GC-QB's
  "reconcile with 3 years of existing QB, idempotent, sync-not-clobber" (§9 QB-1).

### Workspace dependencies — reuse the prior ports' vendored packages, add QuickBooks

The source depends on `@inventory/{auth, gtin, money, org-events-poller,
receipt-types, service-client, web-auth, workflows}`. **The catalog port (#1286)
already vendors `gtin`, `workflows`, `receipt-types`, `receipt-contract-fixtures`;
the inventory port (#1287) already vendors `org-events-poller`; checkin already
vendors `money`.** Expense **reuses** those. New to expense: `service-client` and
— the headline — `@inventory/quickbooks`.

| Source package | Ported? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `@inventory/auth`, `@inventory/web-auth` | **No — dropped** | The source's auth system, retired for checkin next-auth (§6). Drop `jose` with them. |
| `@inventory/gtin` | Reuse | `packages/gtin`, vendored by #1286. |
| `@inventory/workflows` | Reuse | `packages/workflows`, vendored by #1286. Shared xstate helpers. |
| `@inventory/money` | Reuse | Already in checkin `packages/money` (cents math). |
| `@inventory/receipt-types`, `receipt-contract-fixtures` | Reuse (temporary) | Vendored by #1286 as temporary copies. Expense imports the same copy — it needs `CompletedReceiptSchema` (receipt intake, §8) and the S5 `parseOrgEvent` union (provisional events, §8). |
| `@inventory/org-events-poller` | Reuse | `packages/org-events-poller`, vendored by #1287. But **drop the wall-clock timer** — the S5 consumer is push-driven exactly as #1287 §8a decided; expense is a **second consumer** of catalog events (provisional resolution). |
| `@inventory/service-client` | **Yes — new `packages/service-client`** | The typed HTTP client the source uses for the catalog crossings (`/api/internal/*`, org-bearer). Standalone shared package (receipt/orchestrator use it too). It is the **`http` adapter** side of the catalog crossing; once catalog is co-resident the call goes in-process and this is used only for still-remote callees (§8). Check whether #1286/#1287 already vendored it before adding a second copy. |
| `@inventory/quickbooks` | **Yes — new `packages/quickbooks`, NET-NEW to checkin** | The first QuickBooks code in checkin. Read client + OAuth2 (three `fetch` calls, no SDK) + types **already built**; write path + checkin token storage + the outbox-drain terminus are net-new (§9). Standalone shared package — donations (GC-DONOR) and program-finance (GC-PROGRAM-FINANCE) consume it later. |
| `@inventory/pg-test-harness` | n/a | Already present in checkin. Reuse. |

Only genuinely expense-specific helpers (`expense-qb-processor`, `expense-rules`,
`capital-register`, `financial-flow`, `workflow-engine`, `catalog-schemas`,
`inventory-client` wiring) live inside `expense/src/lib`.

---

## 3. Target layout — the meat lives in the library

**Goal: a developer working on expense works entirely inside
`packages/expense`.** Same cut #1286 §3 / #1287 §3 established.

```
checkin/
  packages/
    expense/                              ← the whole app, as a library
      src/
        repositories/  services/  workflows/  lib/       domain (ported verbatim)
        prisma/schema.prisma  prisma/migrations/  generated/   separate schema+client
        components/                        ALL expense UI (Mantine, reskinned)
        pages/                             page components — client
        routes/                            route-handler factories (GET/POST/…)
        nav.ts                             section-tab links (NavLink[]) for the finance area (§7)
        runtime.ts                         configureExpense() + getPrincipal()/db/org/crossing accessors
        contract.ts                        ExpenseAuth / ExpensePrincipal / OrgIdentity + crossing ports (§8) + QB port (§9)
      package.json
    quickbooks/                           NEW — @inventory/quickbooks (first QB code in checkin, §9)
    service-client/                       NEW — the http-adapter client for still-remote crossings
    gtin/  workflows/  receipt-types/  org-events-poller/  money/   REUSED (vendored by #1286/#1287 / already present)
  checkin-app/                            ← WIRING ONLY, no expense logic
    src/instrumentation.ts                + one configureExpense({...}) call at boot (+ QB outbox drain, §9)
    src/app/(finance)/**/{page,route}.tsx  re-export stubs
    src/lib/nav/…                           the library's NavLink[] in the finance section tabs (§7)
    src/security/{registry,scopeBindings}.ts   + expense entries incl. the QB-token secret entry (§5)
    next.config.ts                        + transpilePackages (if tsx needs it — verify, §3)
```

### The cut — same as the prior ports

Next's App Router discovers routes by **filesystem**, so the ~30 route handlers +
~10 page files must physically sit under `checkin-app/src/app`. Each is a
**one-line re-export** of a library module:

```ts
// checkin-app/src/app/(finance)/expenses/[id]/page.tsx
export { default } from '@inventory/expense/pages/expense-detail'

// checkin-app/src/app/(finance)/api/expenses/[id]/line-item-approvals/[approvalId]/approve/route.ts
export { POST } from '@inventory/expense/routes/line-item-approval-approve'
```

**Auth + DB + org + crossings injected without the library importing checkin:**
the library declares interfaces in `contract.ts` (`ExpensePrincipal`,
`ExpenseAuth` with `getPrincipal()` / `requireFinance()` / `requireBoard()` /
`isBudgetOwner()`, `OrgIdentity = { id, name }` behind `getOrg()`), plus the
crossing **ports** (§8) and the **QB port** (§9). checkin-app calls
`configureExpense({ auth, db, org, catalog, inventory, quickbooks, catalogEvents })`
**once** in `instrumentation.ts` — the one justified boot singleton, mirroring
`configureCatalog()` / `configureLocalInventory()`.

**Honest residue** — same three mechanical things that structurally cannot leave
checkin-app: (1) the FS-routing stub files; (2) their `pageRegistry` entries
(checkin's drift guard — project memory); (3) the security registry/scopeBindings
entries (checkin centralizes the boundary on purpose). Adding a *new* expense
route touches all three; editing expense behavior touches none. **One extra boot
concern** expense has: the QB outbox **drain** and the source's crash-recovery
`recoverStrandedQbExpenses()` run once from `instrumentation.ts` (server runtime
only, never during `next build`) — no wall-clock timer, exactly as #1287 §8a
handled the org-events poller (§9).

---

## 4. Database — its own database on the shared server

Own dedicated database (`EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL`) on the same Postgres server as
checkin — separate `schema.prisma`, separate Prisma client, own migration
history. Identical rationale and precedent to #1286 §4 (`@inventory/monitoring-db`).
A dedicated DB namespaces the generic tables (`expenses`, `account_mapping`,
`capital_assets`, …) so **no model/table renames** are needed.

Implications (same as #1286 §4 / #1287 §4, plus):

- **Four Prisma clients** now load in the checkin-app process (catalog +
  local-inventory + expense + checkin), each its own connection string / pool.
  Expense is the **fourth**; the incremental cost is one more bounded connection
  pool. (monitoring-db is the own-DB *packaging* precedent, not the
  second-client-in-Next precedent — that is catalog, #1286.)
- **No cross-database SQL.** expense ↔ catalog ↔ local-inventory ↔ checkin
  crossings are service-level (§8), never SQL joins. The household-COI check (§6)
  reads checkin's `Person`/household graph via the injected principal/port, not a
  cross-DB join.
- **Migrations run independently** — add a `migrate deploy` step against
  `EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL` to the deploy sequence (§9), ordered with checkin's,
  catalog's, and inventory's.
- **`db push` caveat** (project memory): the source relies on `@@unique`
  constraints (`expense_events_org_expense_unique`,
  `part_owner_map_org_gtin_unique`, `capital_assets_org_number_unique`, …) that
  are the idempotency/dedup backstops. Use `migrate deploy`, not `db push`, for
  any DB the uniqueness tests run against.

**The QB token store lives here too** — a small `secret`-tier table (or one
row) in the expense DB, not a gitignored file. See §9.

---

## 5. Adopting checkin's security regime over a separate schema

Same mechanism as #1286 §5 / #1287 §5 (a `generator security` block emitting an
`expense-classifications.ts`, merged in the security core; registry +
scopeBindings entries; responses through checkin's stripper). Two things are
**different from the prior ports**, and both matter:

### Expense data is genuinely sensitive — this is not public reference data

The catalog and inventory ports could widen reads because their data was
non-personal `public`/`internal` reference data. **Expense is not.** Vendor names,
amounts, `reimbursementFor` (names a person and why they were paid),
`submitterId`, and the audit log's before/after values are financial and
person-linked. So the tiering is heavier and the **read audience is narrow** (§6):

- **`secret`** — **QBO OAuth tokens and the client secret** (access token, refresh
  token, `realmId` optional). `secret` fields **never** leave to any client and
  cannot appear in any registry view (a type error if you try). This is the first
  `secret`-tier data the Inventory suite carries; getting it right is the point of
  §9's token-storage decision.
- **`internal`** — **money + vendor + attribution + free text + plumbing**:
  amounts (`*Cents`, `unitPriceCents`, `taxCents`, thresholds), `vendorName`,
  `receiptNumber` / `orderNumber`, `reimbursementFor`, `qbAccount` / account
  mappings, `assetNumber` and the capital register, all actor ids/usernames
  (`submitterId`, `ownerId`, `budgetOwnerUserId`, `decidedByUserId`,
  `capitalOwnerId`, `userId`, `username`), free text (`notes`, `reason`,
  `rejectionReason`, `failureReason`, audit `valueBefore`/`valueAfter`), and
  cross-app plumbing (`payload`, `payloadJson`, `matchedRows`, `receiptId`,
  `sourceQbTxnId`, `sourceEventId`).
- **`public`** — essentially nothing operational leaves the boundary public here.
  (Non-sensitive enums like a hold `status` string are `internal`, surfaced only
  to the finance/board reader.)

**`reimbursementFor` and `submitterId` are person-linked** — treat them at least
`internal` and consider whether the reimbursee's identity warrants `pii`
handling if it is ever joined to a name in a response; default to `internal` +
the narrow read gate, and raise it to `pii` if a route ever returns the person's
contact details alongside.

### The QB token entry ships fail-closed, on its own

Registering the QB token store is a **boundary change** governed by
`AGENTS.md` + the `security-boundary-isolation` workflow: the registry /
scopeBindings / generator changes ship in their **own PR(s)**, ahead of the route
code — **registry-first** (an unused `defineRoute` is inert). The QB-token entry
must land such that **no view can grant `secret`** (the token grammar forbids it),
so the tokens are structurally unreturnable before any QB route exists. This is
**QB-0's** security half (§9) and is the single most process-heavy part of the
port; plan it as its own PR track (§11).

**Route inventory to register** (~20 registry entries, one per verb×route family):
`expenses` (GET/POST-intake) + `expenses/[id]` (+ `capital-review`,
`set-depreciation-cycle`, `line-item-approvals[/*]` approve/reject/assign-owner/
finance-assign/raise-exception/resolve-unknown); `expense-holds[/*]` resolve +
resubmit + line-item account; `account-mapping[/*]` + `/catalog`; `qb-accounts[/*]`;
`capital-assets/seed`; `local-owners`; `ownership-map`; `provisional-items`;
`org-settings`; `system-data`; `queue`; `counts`; `expense-events`;
`received-expense-payloads`. The **inbound** machine seams — `POST /api/expenses`
(receipt intake, org-bearer) and `POST /api/capital-assets/seed` (capital seed,
service/finance token) — are registered with a **service/bearer token grant**, not
the read gate (§8). The **QB OAuth callback route** (QB-0) is registered as an
unauthenticated-but-state-checked endpoint that writes only to the `secret` store.

---

## 6. Auth and roles

**Retire the source auth entirely.** Delete `lib/auth.ts`, `auth-shared.ts`,
`route-auth.ts` (except the pieces re-expressed below), the login page, and
`/api/auth/{login,logout}`. checkin already owns login and session. Every
route/page guard is re-expressed against the checkin session.

### Role mapping — a new `FINANCE` role, existing `BOARD`, budget owner as data

The source has four auth predicates: `isFinance` (dominant — 60 uses),
`isOrgManager`, `isBudgetOwner`, `isAdmin`. checkin's `PersonRoleKind` today is
`SYSADMIN, BOARD, KEYHOLDER, BG_REVIEWER, OPERATIONS` — **no finance role.** The
mapping:

| Source guard | checkin (this port) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `isFinance` (hold resolution, capital seed/review, QB queues, account/vendor mapping, owner-map management, finance-assign, resolve-unknown, raise-exception) | **`FINANCE`** — new `PersonRoleKind` | **RB2 "Role: Finance"** ([#1314](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1314), readiness DECISION) — the umbrella (Treasurer / Bookkeeper / Accountant) GC-ROLES **explicitly keeps**, a kept role not a net-new invention. This port is where #1314 gets stood up; it **partially addresses #1314** (interim single row) **without closing it** — the label/sub-actor split stays #1314's, mirroring #1286↔RB4/#1316. Follows the `isOperations` precedent: PersonRole-table-only, **no legacy mirror column**. |
| `isOrgManager` (account-mapping + owner-assignment management) | **`FINANCE`** (collapsed) | The source's org-manager is finance-staff pipeline management; collapse onto `FINANCE` rather than standing up a second role. Split later only if a real duty boundary appears. |
| `isBudgetOwner` (approve/reject *your own* lines) | **budget-owner predicate on `Person`** — a data relationship, not an RBAC role | The line's owner is a `Person` (resolved via `PartOwnerMap`, FE2); "is this session the owner of this line?" is a per-row check, not a global role. Program Treasurer / Assistant Lead map here too (relationship-attached, GC-ROLES). |
| `isAdmin` (a few admin-only ops) | **`SYSADMIN`** (existing) | Direct. |
| board-level threshold / COI escalation (net-new, GC-FIN-CONTROL) | **`BOARD`** (existing) | The escalation target for threshold-crossed and conflict flags. |

**Adding `FINANCE`** touches checkin's role foundation (all in checkin's own
schema, not the expense schema) exactly as #1286 §6 added `INVENTORY_MANAGER`:
`PersonRoleKind` enum, `src/lib/roles.ts` `FLAG_TO_KIND`, `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`,
`RoleBadge` + the `/api/roles` grant UI. This is **its own PR track** (§11). It is
independent of #1286's `INVENTORY_MANAGER` — expense is finance, not inventory
management, so it does **not** reuse that role.

### Reads are narrow — the port's main divergence from #1286/#1287

Both prior docs widened reads with a broad `isCatalogViewer` /
`isInventoryViewer` gate (any RBAC role / program leader / volunteer), justified
because the data was non-personal public reference data. **Expense inverts that.**
Expense data is financial and person-linked (§5), so least-privilege *narrows*
reads:

- **Finance / board** read the whole expense surface (queues, holds, capital
  register, QB queues).
- **A budget owner** reads **their own lines and the expenses containing them** —
  a per-row scope, not the whole ledger.
- **Program leads / assistant leads / program treasurer** read the
  **budget-vs-actual view for their program** (FE8, later) — a scoped, aggregated
  read, not raw line access.
- **No broad viewer gate.** A volunteer or arbitrary RBAC-role holder does **not**
  read expenses.

**Least-privilege note** (`docs/rules/principles.md`): unlike #1286/#1287 this gate
does not widen anything — it confines financial data to finance, board, and the
row's own owner. Stated here so the divergence from the prior ports is a decision
on the record, not an oversight.

### Flag / checkoff / audit — surface, don't enforce (GC-FIN-CONTROL)

The app **does not enforce approval tiers, COI, or segregation-of-duties.** It
surfaces a **flag** to the right human for a **checkoff**, all **audit-logged**
(`ExpenseAuditLog`). Humans decide; the software records, routes, and proves.
Flags: **tax-attached**, **threshold-crossed** ($500 / $2k / $50 awareness, from
Procurement policy H — *awareness, not enforcement*), **missing-receipt**,
**non-Everyday**, and **COI/conflict**. Each routes to finance or board and lands
a checkoff + audit row. This **replaces** the source's implicit tiering with the
lightweight flag pattern GC-FIN-CONTROL specifies — the flags are low-volume
(~1–2 of each per year) even though the expense process itself is high-volume, so
the flag machinery stays deliberately thin.

### The household-aware COI flag — the port gets *better* in checkin

**The conflict flag is the one flag with real logic**, and it is *buildable here
and was not buildable in the source*: a **household-aware "approver is in the
submitter's household" check** (Q27). The ported `expense-app` never had a
household model, so it could not express COI at all. checkin **has** households, so
this is a genuine port-gets-better item: when a line's would-be approver (owner /
finance-assignee) shares a household with the expense's `submitterId`, raise the
COI flag and route it to `BOARD` for checkoff. Design it as a real predicate over
checkin's household graph (read via the injected principal/port, not a cross-DB
join — §4), not as another rubber-stamp. This directly discharges GC-ROLES'
"expense approval + conflict constraints" duty gap.

### Org + user identity — one injected source, shared with catalog + inventory

Resolved by #1286 §6 — expense **adopts the same decision, not a variant**. Org
identity is a **checkin-owned `Org` registry row** (seeded on the initial
migration with a stable well-known id), injected as an accessor `getOrg()` into
`configureExpense()` — not an env scalar, not a `SettingsData` row, not a cross-DB
read. checkin-app injects the **same** id into catalog, inventory, and expense, so
the `orgId` stamped on `ExpenseEvent`, the S5 provisional events, and the
cross-DB uniques all line up. The `org_id` / `org_name` columns are **kept**
(String). User ids map to checkin **`Person.id`** via the injected
`ExpensePrincipal` (`getPrincipal()`); attribution columns store the principal id
+ a username snapshot, no FK to checkin (separate DB).

---

## 7. UI — reskin in place

All UI lives in the library (`packages/expense/src/{components,pages}`);
checkin-app only re-exports pages (§3) and wires nav. Same Mantine version →
component-level reskin, not a rewrite. **Keep the source's `"use client"` +
`/api/*` pattern** (matches checkin; #1286 §7). Drop `AppShellLayout` /
`NavbarLogout` / `AuthContext`; pages render inside checkin's shell and read
`useSession` client-side + the checkin session in the route handlers.

Pages, each an A13 surface / exception screen:

- `expenses` (list, filtered by the `queue` view) + `expenses/[id]` (detail with
  `LineItemOwnerApprovals`) — surfaces 1/2.
- `expense-holds` **exception screen** — `NO_MATCH` / `MULTIPLE_MATCHES` /
  `NO_PART_NUMBER` account-mapping holds; resolve + resubmit (surface 5).
- `account-mapping` + `qb-accounts` — the rules that map a resolved item to one QB
  account (**one account per line, no category splits, by design**) + the QB
  account list (surface, feeds §9 QB-2).
- `ownership-map` / `local-owners` — budget owners and owner↔PN associations;
  owner-conflict resolution (surface 3, FE2).
- capital review + depreciation panels (`CapitalReviewPanel`,
  `SetDepreciationCyclePanel`) on the expense detail — surface 4, FE4; the
  loop-closing "assign ITFA → log in QB → sticker reminder" step (Q66) lands here.
- `provisional-items` — provisional resolution view (consumes catalog S5 events,
  §8).
- `received-expense-payloads` — receipt-intake ledger (surface for the receipt→
  expense crossing, §8).
- `expense-events` — the QB **outbox** ledger, and (§9 QB-2+) the **QB
  sync-failure / ambiguity queue**.
- `org-settings` (capital thresholds) + `system-data` (settings). The
  `SettingsData` poll fields (`pollIntervalMinutes` / `globalServerUrl`) are **dead
  on arrival** — the S5 crossing is in-process and push-driven (§8), so there is no
  timer to configure. Keep the row (the model ports cleaner intact); drop the
  fields with the deferred cleanup, exactly as #1287 §7 decided.

### Nav placement — a finance area, gated by finance/board (not the Inventory area)

Unlike local-inventory (which joined the catalog's **Inventory** section, #1287
§7), **expense is finance-facing, not inventory-facing**, and its read gate is
narrow (§6). So expense's screens go in a **finance area**, next to checkin's
existing **Finance Ops**, gated by `FINANCE` / `BOARD` — **not** under the
Inventory nav and **not** behind the broad Inventory viewer gate. The library
exports its `NavLink[]` descriptor; checkin-app places it (order is a
checkin-shell concern). Whether this is a new `Expense` / `Finance` section tab
group or folds into the existing Finance Ops tabs is a checkin-shell UI call —
the port just contributes its `NavLink[]` and the `FINANCE`/`BOARD` gate. Badges
(open holds, pending checkoffs, QB queue depth) use checkin's existing `navBadges`
— optional, not first-landing.

*(Open question — whether finance-side Inventory surfaces should eventually share
one area with the Inventory ports is a checkin-shell IA decision, not this port's;
§12.)*

## 8. Pipeline couplings — expense is the money-side tail

Expense sits mid-pipeline: **receipt → expense → (catalog lookups) → inventory
load → QuickBooks**. Four crossings, all designed with the **same per-crossing
rule #1286 §8 set**: *keep the JSON/contract shapes; convert transport, not
architecture; every crossing sits behind a port with an `http` adapter (today) and
an `in-process` adapter (after co-residence); converting a crossing = swap one
adapter binding in `configureExpense()`, zero call-site churn; trigger =
co-residence.*

| Crossing | Direction | Kind | Contract | Today's transport |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R — receipt intake** | receipt-app → expense | **sync RPC — callee** | `CompletedReceiptSchema` (`@inventory/receipt-types`) | `POST /api/expenses`, org-bearer; idempotent on `receiptId` via `ReceivedExpensePayload` |
| **C — catalog lookups** | expense → catalog | **sync RPC — caller** | `catalog-schemas` (categories, subcategories, item info, item lookup) | `service-client` → catalog `/api/internal/*`, org-bearer |
| **I — inventory load** | expense → local-inventory | **sync RPC — caller** (new co-resident wiring) | `ResolvedInventoryDeltaSchema` (local-inventory's apply surface, #1287 §8b) | today mediated by the orchestrator; in checkin, an in-process call into local-inventory's apply port |
| **QB — post** | expense → QuickBooks | **async outbox** | `QbExpenseEventSchema` / `QbLineItemSchema` (schemaVersion 1) | `ExpenseEvent` outbox row; drained by the write path (§9) |

### 8a. Receipt intake (R) — sync RPC, expense is callee

The receipt's **money side** (total / tax / shipping / discount / vendor / lines)
arrives as a `CompletedReceipt` at `POST /api/expenses` (org-bearer), is stored
idempotently in `ReceivedExpensePayload` (keyed on `receiptId` — a re-push is a
safe retry), and `processCompletedReceipt` creates the `Expense` + lines and calls
`initFinancialFlow`. **Idempotency is part of the contract**, preserve it exactly.
At co-residence (when receipt-app migrates) bind the in-process adapter — receipt
calls `processCompletedReceipt` **directly via the port** — and **retire the
org-bearer route last**, after the final remote caller flips. First landing: keep
the `http` route **live** (checkin org-bearer) so a still-remote receipt-app can
drive intake during the overlap.

### 8b. Catalog lookups (C) — sync RPC, expense is caller, catalog already co-resident

The QB processor resolves each line's account by calling the catalog:
`lookupItems` (3-pass matcher) → `getItem` → `listCategories` / `listSubcategories`
(`inventory-client.ts`). **Catalog is already ported (#1286) and co-resident from
expense's first day**, so this crossing binds the **in-process** adapter
immediately — the caller imports the catalog library's service functions via the
port instead of the `service-client` HTTP stub. Keep the `catalog-schemas` zod
shapes as the function param/return types. The `http`/`service-client` adapter
stays in the port only as the fallback for a *remote* catalog (not the case here).

### 8c. Inventory load (I) — sync RPC into local-inventory's apply surface

TOPDOWN GC-FIN-CONTROL describes the high-volume flow as **"signoff → inventory
load → QB"**: when an expense's lines are signed off, the received stock is loaded
into org inventory. In the source monorepo the **orchestrator** (workflow-mapping,
CI4/#1289 — out of scope here) mediates this; expense does not call
local-inventory directly. In checkin, co-resident, the pipeline step is realized as
an **explicit port from expense into local-inventory's apply surface** (defined in
#1287 §8b): on owner-signoff, expense hands the resolved delta to
`receiptService.applyReceipt` / `enqueueItem` via the port, preserving
`ResolvedInventoryDeltaSchema` and its **idempotency on `receiptId`** (a re-push is
a safe retry — that is why the orchestrator can "retry-apply"). Bind the
in-process adapter once local-inventory is co-resident (it will be — #1287 lands
before this); keep the orchestrator's HTTP contract as the `http` fallback for the
overlap window while receipt/orchestrator are still remote. **Do not assume the
orchestrator "collapses away"** — only its transport changes; the apply call is
real and stays behind the port. The known fulfill/apply concurrency hazard
(#1287 §8b, CONCURRENCY.md #2) is *local-inventory's* to close — track it there,
do not re-solve it in expense.

### 8d. Provisional resolution (S5) — async, second consumer of catalog events

Expense is a **second consumer** of catalog's S5 provisional-resolution events
(`provisional_approved` / `_rejected` / `_mapped_to_existing`) — it keeps its own
`ProvisionalItemMap` / `ProvisionalResolution` in step so account resolution can
proceed. This is **async and stays async** (#1286 §8 rule 4): reuse
`@inventory/org-events-poller` but **drop the wall-clock timer** exactly as #1287
§8a decided — boot catch-up drain + drain-on-emit from catalog's post-commit
signal, no `setInterval`. Land the consumer **inert** until catalog emits.
`conversion_challenge_*` events stay unconsumed (BYDESIGN, forward-only), same as
#1287.

### First landing (expense in; catalog + inventory in; receipt/orchestrator not yet)

- Reuse the temporary vendored `receipt-types` / `receipt-contract-fixtures`
  (#1286's copies).
- **R (receipt intake)**: keep the `http` `POST /api/expenses` route **live**
  (org-bearer) for a still-remote receipt-app; exercisable via seeded
  `CompletedReceipt` fixtures.
- **C (catalog)**: bind in-process immediately (catalog co-resident).
- **I (inventory load)**: bind in-process once #1287 is merged (it is a dependency,
  §11); keep the orchestrator HTTP contract as the fallback until receipt/
  orchestrator co-reside.
- **S5**: in-process push adapter, inert until catalog emits.

All temporary duplication is **< 2 weeks, dev-only** — acceptable, tracked.

## 9. QuickBooks — the phase ladder

**QuickBooks is not a stub.** `@inventory/quickbooks` (`packages/quickbooks/` in
the Inventory monorepo) is a working **read-only QBO client**: OAuth2 in three
`fetch` calls (authorize / code→token / refresh — no SDK), a `QuickBooksClient`
that runs QBO SQL-ish queries and pages `Purchase` / `Bill` since a date, a
`toGroundTruth` normalizer, and `QboTokens` / `QboPurchase` / `GroundTruthRecord`
types. Its README states it **"later grows the write path for the `qb_pending`
state-machine terminus"** — that write path is exactly what this port builds. QB
is designed as an **incremental ladder**; each rung states plainly **what already
exists in `@inventory/quickbooks` vs what is net-new.**

Because checkin has **zero** prior QB integration (CUJS A15), this port also
settles GC-QB's *"settle the QB connection/auth first"* — QB-0 is that settlement,
and donations (GC-DONOR) / program-finance (GC-PROGRAM-FINANCE) reuse it.

### QB-0 — bring the client in (connection + auth foundation)

Port `@inventory/quickbooks` into `packages/quickbooks` as the first QB code in
checkin.

- **Exists:** the OAuth2 flow (`authUrl` / `exchangeCode` / `refreshTokens` /
  `isExpired`), `oauthConfigFromEnv` (`QBO_CLIENT_ID` / `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET` /
  `QBO_ENVIRONMENT` / `QBO_REDIRECT_URI`), the sandbox↔production `apiBase` switch,
  `realmId` capture from the consent redirect, and refresh-token **rotation**.
- **Net-new — token storage.** The source persists tokens to a gitignored
  `.qbo-tokens.json` (mode 0600) via `saveTokens`/`loadTokens`. That does not
  survive an ephemeral, multi-replica container and cannot hold a rotating secret
  safely. **Replace the file store with a `secret`-tier row in the expense DB**
  (§4/§5): the token record is `@sensitivity:secret`, structurally unreturnable to
  any client (no view can grant `secret`), and `refreshTokens` **persists the
  rotated refresh token back to the row** (the source's "don't hand-edit the token
  file" invariant becomes "the row is the only writer"). Inject a
  `TokenStore { load(): QboTokens | null; save(t): void }` port so the library
  never imports checkin's DB directly; `configureExpense` binds the DB-backed
  adapter. `QBO_CLIENT_ID` / `SECRET` / `ENVIRONMENT` / `REDIRECT_URI` stay as
  **checkin secrets/env**, not DB rows.
- **Net-new — consent as an operational step.** The source runs consent from a CLI
  script (`npm run consent`) that spins a localhost server to catch the redirect.
  In checkin, consent is a **one-time operator action**: a finance/sysadmin-gated
  page kicks off `authUrl(state)`, and a **QB OAuth callback route**
  (`/api/qb/callback`, registered §5, state-checked) runs `exchangeCode` and writes
  the `secret` row. `QBO_REDIRECT_URI` becomes the deployed callback URL, not
  `localhost:8087`. Sandbox first, production by switching `QBO_ENVIRONMENT` and
  re-consenting.
- **Security:** the whole of §5's `secret` tiering + the fail-closed registry entry
  is QB-0's security half — **registry-first, its own PR.**

### QB-1 — read / ground truth (account mapping + vendor bootstrap + capital seed)

Pull `Purchase` / `Bill` since a date as **ground truth**; use it to bootstrap
account mapping and vendor normalization, and to seed the capital register.

- **Exists:** `purchasesSince` / `billsSince` / `query` / `pagedSince` /
  `toGroundTruth` — the entire read path. The Inventory scripts already consume it
  (`receipt-load-app/scripts/{capital-seed,match-run}.mts` read
  `packages/quickbooks/.ground-truth.json`).
- **Net-new — checkin wiring:** run the pull server-side (or as a checkin
  scheduled job on the **external** scheduler, never an in-app timer), drive
  `AccountMapping` / `ExpenseQbAccount` bootstrap and vendor alias normalization
  from real QB accounts, and expose the **capital-seed intake** (`POST
  /api/capital-assets/seed`, FE4) that parses ITFA tags out of QB memos into the
  `CapitalAsset` register (`seeded=true`, idempotent per `(orgId, assetNumber)`).
  This is also where **GC-QB reconciliation with 3 years of existing QB** starts:
  the `backfill` / `qb_skipped` path (§2) reconciles an expense to an
  already-booked QB transaction without re-posting.

### QB-2 — write path (the `qb_pending` terminus)

Post signed-off expense lines to QuickBooks. **This is the headline net-new
work** and FE3's core.

- **Exists in the source (checkin side of the port):** the `expense-qb-processor`
  already builds and **validates** the outbound payload against `QbExpenseEventSchema`
  / `QbLineItemSchema` (schemaVersion 1), resolves each line to **one** QB account
  (rules → one account/line, **no category splits by design**), allocates
  tax/shipping/discount, and commits the `ExpenseEvent` **outbox row** in one
  transaction (`qb_pending → qb_complete`). The outbox, idempotency
  (`expense_events_org_expense_unique`), holds, and crash-recovery
  (`recoverStrandedQbExpenses`) all port verbatim.
- **Net-new — the actual QBO write.** `@inventory/quickbooks` is read-only today;
  QB-2 **grows its write methods** (create Purchase/Bill from a `QbExpenseEvent`,
  map account name → QBO account ref, vendor ref → QBO vendor, with the same
  OAuth/refresh machinery QB-0 established). A **drain worker** reads unposted
  `ExpenseEvent` rows and posts them; run it from `instrumentation.ts` (boot
  drain + drain-on-commit signal, **no wall-clock timer**, §3) — the outbox stays
  async (rule 4, do not collapse to a direct call).
- **Net-new — the QB sync-failure / ambiguity queue** (A13 step 6). A post can
  fail (auth, validation, QBO rejection) or be **ambiguous** (vendor name matches
  0 or >1 QBO vendors; account name unmatched). These land in a **queue screen**
  (`expense-events`, §7) for finance to resolve — vendor mapping / alias, account
  remap, retry. This mirrors the account-mapping `MULTIPLE_MATCHES` hold pattern
  (§7) but on the QB side. **Idempotency across retries** is essential: a re-post
  of the same `ExpenseEvent` must not double-book (key on the event / a QBO
  idempotency token), per GC-QB "idempotent, sync-not-clobber".

### QB-3 — drift detection & reconciliation (FE5)

Detect and reconcile **external edits** to QB entries the system originated: a
periodic (external-scheduler) re-pull compares system-originated QBO transactions
(tracked by `sourceQbTxnId` / the outbox) against their current QBO state, flags
drift (amount/account/vendor changed in QB after we posted), and routes it to a
reconciliation queue. **Exists:** the read/pull path (QB-1). **Net-new:** the
diff + drift queue. Grounds on GC-QB's "reverse-reconcile against existing QB to
enumerate what the system still can't model."

### Later — noted, not designed

- **FE6** membership/plan payment → QB sync (primary adult; conflict → Financial
  Ambiguity Record; retry → manual queue). Reuses QB-0's connection + the QB-2
  ambiguity-queue pattern. Its own issue (#1277).
- **FE7** shop-hour fee → QB **inter-class journals** (Q49, monthly cadence,
  GC-PROGRAM-FINANCE): checkin has the hours; given rates + application rules it
  initiates monthly journals between QBO classes. A different QBO write shape
  (journal, not Purchase). Its own issue (#1278).
- **FE8** budget-vs-actual view (view-only, per-program, semi-rolling). Depends on
  FE1–FE3 data + FE7. Its own issue (#1279).

These **reuse QB-0's settled connection** and the QB-2 write/ambiguity machinery;
this design neither builds nor blocks them.

---

## 10. Infra / deploy

Adds **no new service** — compiles into `checkin-app`'s build, ships in checkin's
existing container. Same as #1286 §9 / #1287 §9, plus the QB specifics:

- Build the new `packages/*` (`expense`, `quickbooks`, `service-client`); the
  workspace build already covers `packages/*`.
- **Provision the dedicated expense database** + `EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL` secret
  (monitoring-db pattern in the Infra database module).
- Add **expense `prisma migrate deploy`** (against `EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL`) to the
  deploy sequence, ordered with checkin's / catalog's / inventory's steps.
- **QB env/secrets:** `QBO_CLIENT_ID`, `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `QBO_ENVIRONMENT`
  (`sandbox` → `production`), `QBO_REDIRECT_URI` (the deployed callback URL) as
  checkin secrets. The **QBO tokens themselves live in the expense DB `secret`
  row**, not a secret manager and not a file (§9 QB-0).
- **One-time operator step:** run **QB OAuth consent** against the sandbox company
  after first deploy (and again against the real company at production cutover) —
  the only manual step this port adds. Document it in the deploy runbook.
- **Org registry** — the checkin-owned `Org` table + seeded Treehouse row is
  **#1286's** deploy artifact; already present once catalog lands. Expense adds no
  env and no seed here — it receives the injected `org` accessor at boot.
- **Outbox / recovery lifecycle:** **no background timer.** The QB drain worker and
  `recoverStrandedQbExpenses` run once at boot from `instrumentation.ts` (server
  runtime only, never during `next build`); thereafter the drain is woken by the
  in-process commit signal. The QB-1 ground-truth pull and QB-3 drift scan, if
  scheduled, run on checkin's **external** scheduler (cron/Lambda), never an in-app
  `setInterval` — same discipline as #1287 §9.
- No new Caddy route, no new port, no new container.

---

## 11. Phasing (PR tracks)

**Dependency gate.** Expense implementation **follows both prior ports**: it
consumes the catalog's item/account lookups and S5 events (**#1286 must land**),
and it calls local-inventory's apply surface (**#1287 must land** — its §8b apply
port is expense's crossing I target). Track 1 can start once #1286 track 1 (catalog
library skeleton + shared packages) has landed; the inventory-load crossing (track
6) gates on #1287.

1. **Library skeleton** — `packages/expense` (+ new `packages/service-client`;
   reuse `gtin`/`workflows`/`receipt-types`/`org-events-poller`/`money`), expense
   schema + client + migrations, domain (repositories / services / the xstate
   machine / QB processor / capital register / financial-flow) ported,
   unit/integration tests. No UI, no QB write, no checkin wiring. Green in
   isolation.
2. **`FINANCE` role foundation** — add the `FINANCE` `PersonRoleKind` (RB2, a kept
   role — **references #1314 without closing it**; the label/scope stays #1314's
   DECISION) + `roles.ts` + next-auth types + grant UI. Own PR (role-system
   change). Defines the budget-owner per-row predicate + the household-COI
   predicate over checkin's household graph.
3. **Security boundary** — `@sensitivity` annotations (incl. the **`secret`** QB
   token tier), `generator security` for the expense schema, registry +
   scopeBindings entries, the **fail-closed QB-token registry entry**. Own PR
   track, **registry-first**. (This is QB-0's security half.)
4. **Routes + auth + inbound seams** — library route-handler factories +
   `contract.ts` (incl. the crossing ports + the QB `TokenStore` port) +
   `configureExpense` wired in `instrumentation.ts`; API stub tree + narrow read
   guards + the household-COI flag; the `R` (receipt intake, org-bearer) and
   capital-seed inbound surfaces with their `http` adapters live; the `C` (catalog)
   crossing bound in-process. Depends on 1–3.
5. **UI + nav** — reskinned pages/components (in the library), page stub tree +
   `pageRegistry` entries, the library's `NavLink[]` in a **finance area** gated by
   `FINANCE`/`BOARD` (not the Inventory area — §7), `transpilePackages` (if tsx
   needs it — verify), A13 flow test.
6. **Inventory-load crossing (I)** — bind the in-process call into local-inventory's
   apply port on owner-signoff (#1287 §8b), keeping the orchestrator HTTP contract
   as the `http` fallback. Depends on #1287 landed.
7. **S5 provisional consumer** — bind the in-process catalog-events adapter
   (push-driven, no timer), inert until catalog emits. Depends on #1286's
   post-commit signal hook.

**QB sub-sequence** (its own explicit ladder, interleaved with the tracks above):

- **QB-0** (connection + auth) — the QB client package + OAuth consent page +
  callback route + the **`secret` token store**. Its security half **is track 3**
  (registry-first, fail-closed); its code half is a small PR after track 3.
  **Everything QB depends on QB-0.**
- **QB-1** (read / ground truth) — pull + account-mapping / vendor bootstrap +
  capital-seed intake (FE4). After QB-0. Feeds tracks 4–5.
- **QB-2** (write path / `qb_pending` terminus) — the net-new QBO **write methods**
  in `@inventory/quickbooks`, the outbox **drain worker**, and the **QB
  sync-failure / ambiguity queue** (FE3, A13 step 6). After QB-0 and after the
  domain/outbox tracks (1, 4). **The QB write path follows the QB read/client-port
  — QB-2 cannot precede QB-0/QB-1.**
- **QB-3** (drift / reconciliation, FE5) — after QB-2.

8. **Infra** — deploy sequence + expense DB provisioning + QB env/secrets + the
   consent runbook step.
9. **(Deferred — each a tracked follow-up issue vs the FE issues, not prose
   "later")** retire the `http`-adapter routes when receipt-app / orchestrator
   co-reside and flip to in-process; drop the dead `SettingsData` poll fields;
   FE6 (membership→QB, #1277), FE7 (shop-hour journals, #1278), FE8
   (budget-vs-actual, #1279); QB-3 drift-queue polish. File these at merge.

## 12. Open items / assumptions

- **`FINANCE` role naming — the one open DECISION (RB2 / #1314).** This design
  introduces a `FINANCE` `PersonRoleKind` as the RB2 "Finance" umbrella actor.
  RB2 is tracked as **[#1314](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1314)
  (readiness DECISION)** — the decision it names is exactly this: stand up a
  finance role, and under what label. GC-ROLES keeps RB2 and says "no net-new RBAC
  rows"; `FINANCE` is the *umbrella* row, with Treasurer / Bookkeeper / Accountant
  as sub-actors that are **not** separate rows. If the owner wants a different
  label (e.g. `TREASURER`) or wants finance folded onto `BOARD` instead of a
  distinct row, that is a one-line change in track 2. The doc picks `FINANCE` as
  the sensible default — **not a STOP-AND-ASK blocker** — but this is the product
  choice worth the owner's nod, and it is #1314's to settle. Track 2 references
  #1314 without closing it.
- **Narrow read gate is a deliberate divergence** from #1286/#1287's broad viewer
  gate (§6). Confirmed by least-privilege + the sensitivity of financial data; if
  the owner wants finance data more broadly visible (e.g. all board, all program
  leads), that widens the gate — but the default is narrow. On the record here.
- **`reimbursementFor` / reimbursee identity tiering** — defaulted to `internal`
  behind the narrow gate; raise to `pii` if a route ever returns the person's
  contact details alongside (§5). Assumption, not a blocker.
- **Nav IA — finance area vs shared Inventory area.** Expense lands in a
  finance-gated area next to Finance Ops (§7). Whether checkin later unifies the
  finance-side and inventory-side surfaces into one IA is a checkin-shell decision,
  not this port's — noted, not resolved.
- **QuickBooks account/vendor identity.** QB-2's account-name → QBO-account-ref and
  vendor-name → QBO-vendor-ref mapping assumes the QBO chart of accounts + vendor
  list are the authority; QB-1's ground-truth pull bootstraps the mapping tables.
  The **ambiguity queue** (QB-2) is the designed escape hatch when a name matches 0
  or >1 — so no STOP-AND-ASK: ambiguity is handled in-band by a human, not guessed.
- **Production data: none to migrate; existing QB is reconciled, not imported.**
  There is no expense data to import. Expenses arrive **by receipt intake** (the
  R crossing, §8) — the high-volume path — or by hand for reimbursements. The
  **existing 3 years of QuickBooks** are **reconciled against, not clobbered**
  (GC-QB): QB-1's ground-truth pull + the `backfill`/`qb_skipped` path recognize
  already-booked transactions; the capital register is seeded from QB memos
  (FE4). "No bulk expense import" and "reconcile existing QB" do not conflict —
  different mechanisms.
- **Dev/test seed.** Lift the expense baseline (org settings / account mappings /
  a `CompletedReceipt` fixture / a capital-seed sample) from the Inventory
  monorepo's `scripts/setup-test-data.sh` + the QB `.ground-truth.json` sample;
  **drop the transport** (the checkin seed writes directly via the expense library
  services / Prisma client against `EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL`). Stamp rows with the
  same seeded `Org` id (§6). Add `VolunteerDesignation` / household rows (project
  memory: seed has 0 volunteer designations) so the household-COI flag and the
  budget-owner per-row gate are exercisable in dev and flow tests. **QB tests use
  the sandbox company, never live production QB** (§ testing below) — no test tier
  posts to a real books.
- **Deferral discipline.** Anything past the first landing (track 9) is a **GitHub
  follow-up issue referencing the relevant FE issue**, filed at merge — never a
  bare "later" in prose or a code comment.

### Testing (posture; mirrors #1286 §10 / #1287 §10)

- **Unit/integration — keep vitest, port ~verbatim.** `expense` is a `packages/`
  package → keeps vitest (jest is checkin-app's convention). Reuse
  `@inventory/pg-test-harness`. **CI wiring is not automatic** — add an explicit
  root run (or extend the aggregation #1286/#1287 added) so its suites execute.
- **Security tests** — registry/stripper coverage for expense routes (and
  **especially** that no view can return the `secret` QB tokens) lives in
  `checkin-app/src/security/__tests__` (jest — checkin boundary wiring). Companion
  to the track-3 boundary PR.
- **e2e = flow tests, not Playwright.** Re-express the source's Playwright specs as
  `flow-tests/*.flow.test.ts`. Priority journey: **A13 end to end** — receipt
  intake → per-line owner approval → capital review + depreciation → account
  resolution (incl. a `MULTIPLE_MATCHES` hold + resubmit) → QB outbox emit → (QB-2)
  QB post → ambiguity-queue resolve. Land in track 5 (domain flow) + a QB-2 flow
  once the write path exists.
- **QB tests hit the QBO sandbox only.** The write path and OAuth are tested
  against a QBO **sandbox** company (the source's model), gated out of the default
  CI run (they need external creds + network) exactly as the Inventory monorepo's
  `*.shopify-live.ts` are (`AGENTS.md` shopify-live precedent). **No CI tier posts
  to production QuickBooks.**
- **Coupling tests** — the crossing ports (R/C/I) get contract tests on both
  adapters (`http` and `in-process` produce identical results for the same input).

**Resolved by reuse of #1286/#1287:** own dedicated database
(`EXPENSE_DATABASE_URL`); checkin security regime over a separate schema; retire
source auth for checkin next-auth; org+user identity from the checkin-owned `Org`
registry row injected as an accessor; keep-JSON-contracts / convert-transport
crossing rule; vitest + flow-tests (no Playwright); no table renames; no in-app
timers.
**New to this port (resolved here):** the `FINANCE` role + narrow read gate;
the household-aware COI flag (port gets better); QuickBooks as `@inventory/quickbooks`
brought into checkin on the QB-0…QB-3 ladder with `secret`-tier DB token storage.
**Left open (non-blocking):** the `FINANCE`-vs-`TREASURER` label nod; the finance/
inventory nav IA question; the tracked deferrals (track 9) and FE6–FE8.

*Design for #1272 (FE1) and epic FE (#1272–#1279). Third app of the whole-Inventory
migration; downstream of receipt-app, coupled to the catalog (#1286) and
local-inventory (#1287), both of which land first. Brings the first QuickBooks
integration into checkin via `@inventory/quickbooks` on an explicit phase ladder.
Temporary duplication at the receipt-app / orchestrator boundaries is expected and
tracked.*
