# Org inventory: porting `local-inventory-app` into checkin

## Problem

The organization tracks what it physically *has* on hand — parts, tools, and
consumables, by location, with a running log of every quantity change — and
turns received receipts into inventory. Today that lives in a separate
application, on separate infrastructure, behind its own login, that the
organization is retiring. Staff who receive stock, resolve mismatches, or read
on-hand counts cannot do it where they already work (checkin), and it is one
piece of a larger set of inventory tools that must all move to one place — it
sits at the *end* of the receipt→catalog→inventory pipeline, so it only earns
its value once the pieces upstream of it move too.

## Objective

Org inventory is available inside the existing staff application as ordinary
navigation, under the same **Inventory** area as the catalog, using the same
sign-in and look and feel, deployed and operated as one system — with the
inventory logic kept cleanly separable, and its catalog/orchestrator couplings
(catalog org-events in, orchestrator delta-apply in, catalog item reads out)
designed as explicit, swappable seams so the rest of the pipeline can land on
them rather than around them.

## Executive summary

- **Staff** reach org inventory under the existing **Inventory** nav area (new
  section tabs, not a second top-level item); writes need the one interim
  `INVENTORY_MANAGER` role, everyone with a staff relationship can read.
- **Operators** get nothing new to run — same one application, same deploy; org
  inventory adds its own database on the shared server and no background timer.
- **Developers** get org inventory as an isolated library: logic, data, and
  screens in one package; the host application only wires it in.
- **The organization** gets the pipeline's terminal sink moved onto the same seam
  the catalog established, so receipt-app and the orchestrator migrate onto it.

**Issue:** [#1287](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1287)
— backlog item CI2 (PORT · NEEDS-DESIGN · L). Journey **A12** in
`docs/backlog/CUJS.md`.

**Status:** design. No board decision gates the mechanics below. This doc is the
**exact parallel** of the global-catalog design ([#1286](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1286),
`docs/in-design/1286_GLOBAL_CATALOG_INTEGRATION.md`) and **reuses its base
architecture decisions verbatim** — read that doc first. Everything here is the
same shape applied to the org-inventory app, plus the two upstream couplings
that make local-inventory a *sink* rather than a leaf. The write role
(`INVENTORY_MANAGER`) is #1286's interim reduction; the strategic role split
stays open in RB4 ([#1316](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1316))
— see §6.

**Source:** `local-inventory-app/` in the `innovationtreehouse/Inventory` repo
(a separate repo — not vendored here). Not currently deployed in Infra.

**Domain rules relied on:** `docs/rules/principles.md` (least-privilege — the
viewer gate in §6 widens read access and is justified there); the
security-boundary and migration-order rules cited inline in §5 and §4.

**Dependency:** local-inventory is **downstream of the global catalog** in the
E-PIPELINE (`receipt → workflow-mapping orchestrator → catalog + local-inventory`).
Its implementation **follows** #1286 — it consumes catalog org-events (§8),
reuses the shared packages #1286 vendors (§2), and joins the **Inventory** nav
area #1286 creates (§7). Do not land local-inventory before the catalog library
exists.

---

## 1. Goal and shape

Bring org inventory into checkin as **more nav items in the existing checkin app
— one Next.js process, one Infra deploy** — not a second service. Identical to
the catalog decision (#1286 §1).

**The whole app — domain *and* UI — lands as an isolated library package**
(`@inventory/local-inventory`): services, repositories, workflows (xstate state
machines), Prisma schema/client, and every React component, page, and route
handler. `checkin-app` holds **only structural wiring, no inventory logic**:
filesystem-routing re-export stubs, one `configureLocalInventory()` boot call
that injects checkin's auth + DB, a nav splice, and the security-registry entries
(§5). The dependency arrow points one way — **the library never imports checkin;
checkin injects into the library.**

This is the **second app of the whole-Inventory migration** (catalog is first).
Where local-inventory touches Inventory apps that have not moved yet
(receipt-app, workflow-mapping-app), we bring **temporary copies / keep the HTTP
seam** exactly as #1286 §8 prescribes — temporary meaning **< 2 weeks, dev-only,
never in a release** — with a clean port at each crossing.

### Decisions locked (carried over from #1286, adapted)

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| DB topology | **Own dedicated database** (`LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL`) on the **same Postgres server** — separate `schema.prisma` + own Prisma client + own migrations. Same `@inventory/monitoring-db` precedent #1286 followed. The source already reads `LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL` (see `container.ts`), so the env-var name is inherited, not invented. |
| Security regime | **Adopt checkin's** registry + `@sensitivity` generator + stripper + scopeBindings over the separate schema (§5). |
| Auth | **Retire** `local-inventory-app`'s `@inventory/auth` + `@inventory/web-auth` (+ `bcrypt`/`jose`, the login page, `/api/auth/{login,logout,me}`). checkin next-auth session is the only auth. |
| Roles | **Reuse the `INVENTORY_MANAGER` role #1286 introduces** — the source's `organization_manager` (write) collapses into it. Viewer = the same broad gate #1286 defined. See §6. **No new role.** |
| Scope | **Full port** of the four A12 surfaces (§ below), with temporary shims at the not-yet-migrated receipt-app / workflow-mapping boundaries (§8). |
| UI location | **All UI in the library** — components, pages, route handlers. checkin-app only re-exports and mounts (§3). |
| UI style | **Keep the client pattern** — `"use client"` pages + `/api/*` routes; re-auth + re-theme only. Matches checkin's dominant pattern, same as #1286 §7. |
| `orgId` / user identity | **Keep the columns; inject the values** — resolved by #1286 §6. `orgId` is load-bearing (`Location.orgId`, `@@unique([orgId, gtin13])`, `ProvisionalResolution`'s org-scoped unique, every S4/S5 contract). Keep it. Org identity comes from a **checkin-owned `Org` registry table** (seeded on initial migration with a stable well-known id), injected as an **accessor** `org: getOrg(): OrgIdentity` — **not** an env scalar, **not** a `SettingsData` row, **not** a cross-DB read. User ids (`userId`/`proposedByUserId`/…) map to checkin **`Person.id`** via the injected principal. Both flow through the single `configureLocalInventory()` injection (§6). |

### The four A12 surfaces (scope)

1. **OrgItem + locations** — create / reassign locations; per-org item rows.
2. **Receive queue + fulfill** — delta-apply in/out per location/owner + an
   inventory log (audit of every quantity change).
3. **Inventory merge-conflict detection + resolution queue** — the exception
   screen (uom_mismatch parking; see §7, §8).
4. **Provisional-item resolution** — **consumes catalog org-events** (the S5
   coupling; §8).

---

## 2. What the source is

`local-inventory-app` is a Next 16 / React 19 / Mantine 7 / Prisma 7 app — the
**same stack checkin already runs**, and the same stack as `global-catalog-app`.
It is cleanly layered (DI container wires singletons):

```
src/
  lib/repositories/   inventory, location, orgEvents, provisionalItem,
                      provisionalResolution, receiveQueue                (Prisma access)
  lib/services/       inventory, location, orgSettings, provisionalItem,
                      receipt, receiveQueue, user, serviceError          (domain logic)
  workflows/          xstate machines: provisional-item, merge-conflict,
                      received-org-event                                 (lifecycle guards)
  lib/                gtin, container (DI), org-events-poller, api-client (portable)
                      auth, auth-shared, route-auth                      (RETIRE — see §6)
  app/api/…           route handlers (thin: guard → validate → service → response)
  app/(app)/…         page.tsx (client) per surface
  components/         AppShell, AuthProvider, MantineProvider            (reskin/retire)
prisma/schema.prisma  14 models (own migrations)
```

**Prisma models** (own schema, `@@map` to snake_case tables): `Location`,
`OrgItem`, `InventoryLog`, `ReceiveQueue`, `SettingsData`,
`InventoryProvisionalItem` (renamed from the source's `ProvisionalItem` to avoid a
merged-classifications name collision with catalog's `ProvisionalItem`; table
`provisional_items` preserved via `@@map` — §4),
`InventoryMergeConflict`, `ProvisionalResolution`, `ReceivedOrgEvent`,
`ProvisionalItemLog`, `ReceivedInventoryDelta`, `LocationLog`. (12 declared;
plus the two Prisma-generated join/relation surfaces on `Location`↔`OrgItem`.)

The domain layer is framework-light and ports almost verbatim. The friction is
**auth wiring and the catalog/orchestrator crossings** (§8), not the domain.

### Workspace dependencies — reuse #1286's vendored packages, add two

The source depends on `@inventory/{auth, web-auth, gtin, workflows, receipt-types,
receipt-contract-fixtures, org-events-poller, utils, pg-test-harness}`.
Disposition — **the catalog port (#1286) already vendors `gtin`, `workflows`,
`receipt-types`, `receipt-contract-fixtures`; local-inventory REUSES those, does
not re-vendor.** New to local-inventory: `org-events-poller` (the consumer side —
catalog is a *producer* and never needed it) and `utils`.

| Source package | Ported? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `@inventory/auth`, `@inventory/web-auth` | **No — dropped** | The source's auth system, retired for checkin next-auth (§6). |
| `@inventory/gtin` | Reuse | Already `packages/gtin` (vendored by #1286). No second copy. |
| `@inventory/workflows` | Reuse | Already `packages/workflows` (vendored by #1286). Shared xstate helpers. |
| `@inventory/receipt-types`, `receipt-contract-fixtures` | Reuse (temporary) | Already vendored by #1286 as temporary copies — local-inventory imports the same copy. Endgame: the permanent shared contract when receipt-app lands. |
| `@inventory/org-events-poller` | **Yes — new `packages/org-events-poller`, deferred to track 6** | Shared S5 outbox-consumer machinery (cursor, ledger write, `assertTransition`, `onEvent` dispatch). Consumed by local-inventory/expense/workflow-mapping — a cross-app utility, **standalone package**, not folded into `local-inventory`. **Drive its drain from the in-process signal + boot, not its `setInterval`** (§8a) — expose/extract a one-shot `drainOnce` if the package only ships the timer-start today; the wall-clock loop is not used in checkin. **Confirmed in build: no Track-1 domain/unit file imports it**, so it lands with the S5 consumer (track 6), not the library skeleton. |
| `@inventory/utils` | **Yes — new `packages/utils`, only if/when imported** | Generic helpers. Standalone shared package. **Confirmed in build: no Track-1 domain/unit file imports it** — vendor it in the track that first needs it (reuse #1286's copy if it vendored one by then), not in track 1. |
| `@inventory/pg-test-harness` | n/a | Already present in checkin. Reuse. |

Only genuinely inventory-specific helpers (`lib/gtin.ts` is a thin re-export;
`api-client.ts`, `container.ts`, `org-events-poller.ts` wiring) live inside
`local-inventory/src/lib`.

---

## 3. Target layout — the meat lives in the library

**Goal: a developer working on org inventory works entirely inside
`packages/local-inventory`.** Same cut #1286 §3 established.

```
checkin/
  packages/
    local-inventory/                      ← the whole app, as a library
      src/
        repositories/  services/  workflows/  lib/       domain (ported verbatim)
        prisma/schema.prisma  prisma/migrations/  generated/   separate schema+client
        components/                        ALL inventory UI (Mantine, reskinned)
        pages/                             page components — client
        routes/                            route-handler factories (GET/POST/…)
        nav.ts                             section-tab links (NavLink[]) for the Inventory area (§7)
        runtime.ts                         configureLocalInventory() + getPrincipal()/db/org accessors
        contract.ts                        InventoryAuth / InventoryPrincipal / OrgIdentity + crossing ports (§8)
      package.json
    org-events-poller/  utils/            new vendored @inventory/* deps
    gtin/  workflows/  receipt-types/     REUSED — vendored by #1286
  checkin-app/                            ← WIRING ONLY, no inventory logic
    src/instrumentation.ts                + one configureLocalInventory({...}) call at boot
    src/app/(inventory)/**/{page,route}.tsx  re-export stubs (under the Inventory area #1286 opened)
    src/lib/nav/…                           append the library's NavLink[] to the Inventory section tabs (§7)
    src/security/{registry,scopeBindings}.ts   + inventory entries (boundary is checkin's)
    next.config.ts                        + transpilePackages (if tsx needs it — verify, §3)
```

### The cut — same as #1286

Next's App Router discovers routes by **filesystem**, so ~23 route handlers +
8 page files must physically sit under `checkin-app/src/app`. Each is a
**one-line re-export** of a library module:

```ts
// checkin-app/src/app/(inventory)/inventory/org-inventory/page.tsx
export { default } from '@inventory/local-inventory/pages/org-inventory'

// checkin-app/src/app/(inventory)/api/inventory/receive-queue/route.ts
export { GET, POST } from '@inventory/local-inventory/routes/receive-queue'
```

**Auth + DB + org injection without the library importing checkin:** the library
declares interfaces in `contract.ts` (`InventoryPrincipal`, `InventoryAuth` with
`getPrincipal()` / `requireManager()` / `isViewer()`, `OrgIdentity = { id, name }`
behind an accessor `getOrg(): OrgIdentity`), plus the crossing **ports** (§8).
checkin-app calls `configureLocalInventory({ auth, db, org, catalogEvents })`
**once** in `instrumentation.ts` — the one justified boot singleton, mirroring
`configureCatalog()`. The `org` accessor is backed by **checkin's `Org` registry
table** (§6) — never a `SettingsData` row, never a cross-DB read.

**Honest residue** — same three mechanical things that structurally cannot leave
checkin-app: (1) the FS-routing stub files; (2) their `pageRegistry` entries
(checkin's drift guard — project memory); (3) the security registry/scopeBindings
entries (checkin centralizes the boundary on purpose). Adding a *new* inventory
route touches all three; editing inventory behavior touches none.

**One extra boot concern local-inventory has that catalog does not:** the source
`container.ts` **starts a time-based org-events poller on import** (guarded by
`LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL` being set, so `next build` doesn't connect). checkin
**drops the interval poller entirely** — an in-app `setInterval` would keep the
container's event loop awake forever and fight clean shutdown. Instead the S5
consumer is **push-driven** (§8a): a one-shot **boot catch-up drain** from
`configureLocalInventory()` / `instrumentation.ts` (server runtime only, never a
container-import side effect, never during `next build`), plus **drain-on-emit**
signalled in-process by catalog's producer. No wall-clock timer. Land it **inert**
until the catalog producer emits (§8, §11).

---

## 4. Database — its own database on the shared server

Own dedicated database (`LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL`) on the same Postgres
server as checkin — separate `schema.prisma`, separate Prisma client, own
migration history. Identical rationale and precedent to #1286 §4
(`@inventory/monitoring-db`). A dedicated DB namespaces the generic **tables**
(`org_items`, `locations`, `inventory_log`, …) so **no table renames** are needed.

**One model-*name* rename is required, though** (Track-3 finding — corrects the
"model names disjoint" claim inherited from #1286). Catalog and inventory both
declare a `ProvisionalItem` Prisma model, and the two `generator security`
classifications **merge into one `core.ts`**, so the model *names* collide there
even though the tables don't. Resolution: rename the **inventory** model to
**`InventoryProvisionalItem`**, with `@@map("provisional_items")` preserving the
table (no migration/data impact). This is a **Track-1** change (the model name +
every library consumer of it) that must land **with or before** the Track-3
boundary PR — otherwise the merged classifications have a duplicate key.

Implications (same as #1286 §4, plus):

- **Three Prisma clients** now load in the checkin-app process (catalog +
  local-inventory + checkin), each its own connection string / pool. Catalog
  (#1286) is the **first** second client inside checkin-app (monitoring-db is
  consumed only by Lambdas/`packages/*`, never by checkin-app — it is the own-DB
  *packaging* precedent, not the second-client-in-Next precedent). local-inventory
  is the **third** — the incremental cost is one more bounded connection pool.
- **No cross-database SQL.** local-inventory ↔ catalog ↔ checkin crossings are
  service-level (§8), never SQL joins. The S5 consumer reads catalog's OrgEvent
  rows via the catalog **service/port**, not a cross-DB join.
- **Migrations run independently** — add a `migrate deploy` step against
  `LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL` to the deploy sequence (§9).
- **`db push` caveat** (project memory): the source relies on partial-unique and
  `@@unique` constraints; use `migrate deploy`, not `db push`, for any DB the
  P2002/uniqueness tests run against. The source already ships six ordered
  migrations under `prisma/migrations/` — port them as-is.

---

## 5. Adopting checkin's security regime over a separate schema

Same mechanism as #1286 §5 (a third `generator security` block emitting a
classifications file, merged in the security core; registry entries; responses
through checkin's stripper). **As #1286 built it (Track 3):** the generator's
`provider` path is CWD-relative to the package dir
(`node ../../checkin-app/scripts/security-generator.js`) and writes **cross-package
into `checkin-app/src/security/generated/`**, so the package's `prisma generate`
(incl. `postinstall`) depends on checkin-app's generator script — fine in the
monorepo, breaks only if the package is later extracted. Merge point is a **spread
in `core.ts`**, not a new aggregator file.

**No scopeBindings, but two opt-outs** (Track-3 as-built — corrects the earlier
"bindings are zero, nothing else" wording). The `*ByUserId` / `performedBy` FKs
are **not** in checkin's `SCOPABLE_FIELDS`, so the validator auto-classes those
models un-scopable / admin-only. **But bare `userId` IS in `SCOPABLE_FIELDS`** —
and `InventoryLog` + `LocationLog` both carry a bare `userId`. That `userId` is a
**foreign id space** (a snapshot of the acting user, not a checkin `Person` scope
to bind on), and admin-only is the intended visibility, so the two models are
added to **`OPT_OUT_PENDING_ROUTE`** (an explicit opt-out, **not** a scopeBinding).
Net: **two `OPT_OUT_PENDING_ROUTE` entries, zero scopeBindings** — the registry
entries + those two opt-outs are the work.

**Field tiering** — inventory reference/quantity data is largely operational, not
personal. The schema has **no email/DOB/address fields → no `pii` tier**.

- **`public` / `internal` (operational):** `gtin13`, quantities
  (`existingQuantity`, `desiredQuantity`, `quantity`), `Location.name`,
  location assignments, conversion factors/versions, statuses, `changeType`,
  `eventType`. On-hand quantity and locations are posted operationally in the
  building — treat as `public`/`internal`, not sensitive (matches the
  cert-status-public-by-design posture; project memory). **`orgId`** is an
  org-scoping token, `internal`.
- **`internal` — actor attribution:** `userId`, `username`, `proposedByUserId`,
  `resolvedByUserId`, `performedBy`, `performedByUsername` (who did what).
- **`internal` — free text:** `rejectionReason`, `failureReason`, `notes`,
  `resolution` (may carry incidental sensitive text).
- **`internal` — cross-app plumbing:** `receiptId`, `ReceivedOrgEvent.payload`,
  `ReceivedInventoryDelta.deltaJson`, `sourceEventId`, `lineItemId`.

**Boundary-isolation process applies** (`AGENTS.md` + the
`security-boundary-isolation` workflow): registry / generator changes ship in
their **own PR(s)**, ahead of the route code — **registry-first** (an unused
`defineRoute` is inert). This is the most process-heavy part; plan it as its own
PR track (§11).

**CI gap the multi-schema regime forces (Track-3 finding).** The
`security-boundary-isolation` workflow's `is_companion` check **hardcoded only
`checkin-app/prisma/schema.prisma`** as an allowed companion to a boundary PR. A
boundary PR that also ships a **package** schema (`packages/local-inventory/…/schema.prisma`)
is therefore flagged a violation — catalog #1286's own Track-3 PR would trip it on
a clean `main` base (it apparently landed via a non-`main` base / admin merge).
Track 3 must extend `is_companion` to accept `packages/global-catalog` **and**
`packages/local-inventory` schemas as explicit companions. Without that fix the
inventory boundary PR cannot ship the `@sensitivity`-annotated package schema
alongside the registry/generator changes.

**Route-endpoint-string gotcha** (#1286 Track-4): the `endpoint` string each
handler passes to `handler()` must be the **full registered path including its
prefix** — a string that drops a segment makes `getRoute()` miss the registry and
the route 500s at runtime (tsc-green). Every catalog route hit this until fixed;
a guard test now covers it. Watch for it on the inventory routes.

**Route inventory to register** (~13 registry entries, one per verb×route family):
`locations` (GET/POST) + `locations/[id]` (PATCH/DELETE) + `locations/[id]/reassign`
(POST); `org-items` (GET) + `org-items/[gtin13]` (PATCH); `receive-queue` (GET) +
`receive-queue/[id]` + `.../fulfill` (POST);
`inventory-log` (GET); `inventory-merge-conflicts` (GET) +
`.../[id]/resolve` (POST); `provisional-items` (GET/POST);
`received-inventory-deltas` (GET); `received-org-events` (GET); `system-data`
(GET) — all **human** routes: read gate `authorize: 'catalog-viewer'` (reused
verbatim — the inventory gate ≡ catalog's, §6), write gate `INVENTORY_MANAGER`.
The source's `global-catalog/items*` proxy routes are **not registered** —
dropped for an in-process catalog read (§8b). The `/api/internal/*` +
`/api/inventory/apply` **machine** surface is **not registered and not hosted** —
checkin has no way to gate a machine-bearer route (§8c); the apply crossing is
in-process only.

---

## 6. Auth and roles

**Retire the source auth entirely.** Delete `lib/auth.ts`, `auth-shared.ts`,
`route-auth.ts` (except the pieces re-expressed below), `LoginForm`/`login` page,
`AuthProvider`, and `/api/auth/{login,logout,me}`. checkin already owns login and
session. The source's `route-auth`/`web-auth` parse+error helpers
(`parseBody`/`parseQuery`/`unauthorized`/…) go with it; the library route layer
uses a **next-free `src/routes/_shared.ts`** (parse/validate throwing via an
injected `httpError` factory — checkin's `ApiResponseError`), mirroring #1286's
Track-4 pattern, so the library imports **no `next/server`**.

Every route/page guard is re-expressed against the checkin session. The source's
guards map cleanly:

| Source guard | checkin (this port) | strategic (#1316) |
|---|---|---|
| `canEditOrg` (writes: fulfill, apply, reassign, resolve, org-item edit) — the source's `organization_manager` | **`INVENTORY_MANAGER`** (the interim role #1286 adds — reuse, no new role) | **`ORG_MANAGER`** (net-new, gated on #1316) |
| `canViewOrg` (reads: queues, lists, logs) | the viewer gate #1286 defined — authenticated **and** any RBAC-role holder / program leader / volunteer | (unchanged) |
| `requireOrgBearer` (`/api/inventory/apply`, S3 delta from orchestrator) | checkin's **org-bearer / internal token** — the inbound machine seam (§8) | (unchanged) |
| `requireServiceKey` (`X-Service-Key`, `/api/internal/*` from receipt/orchestrator) | checkin's **internal service-key** grant — the inbound machine seam (§8) | (unchanged) |

**No role-foundation change is needed for local-inventory** — `INVENTORY_MANAGER`
already lands in #1286's track 2. This doc's implementation simply *depends on*
that role existing. **Track 2 as-built (`claude/nostalgic-wilbur-ddc7e8`):
inventory read-eligibility is verified ≡ catalog's exactly** — same legs (RBAC
role / program leader / volunteer, incl. `isInventoryManager` + the volunteer
claim) on both the server `catalog-viewer` resolver and client
`isCatalogViewerClient`. So it **reuses `isCatalogViewer` verbatim — no
`isInventoryViewer*` fork** (a forward-ref comment marks the reuse at the
predicate). No divergence, so the "define a thin predicate" alternative is moot.

**Naming call-out for T3/T4** (chosen tradeoff, not a surprise): a server-side
*inventory-named* gate cannot be introduced in Track 2/4 scope — a new resolver
case lives in `core.ts` / `access-resolvers.ts`, which are **boundary files
(Track 3)**. So inventory routes register **`authorize: 'catalog-viewer'`** — a
catalog-named authz string on inventory routes. **Functionally correct** (byte-
identical gate). If the design later wants an inventory-named boundary symbol for
call-site clarity, that is a **deliberate Track 3 registry/grammar decision**
(add an `inventory-viewer` resolver alias in the boundary layer), never a Track 4
route-level change. Default: reuse `catalog-viewer`; only fork the name if a
reviewer finds the catalog-named string on inventory routes genuinely confusing.

**Client mirror uses #1286's claim — no new session field.** The volunteer input
to the gate is email-keyed `VolunteerDesignation` with no session flag; #1286
Track-5 added a **`hasVolunteerDesignation` JWT/session claim** so a client-side
`isCatalogViewerClient` mirrors the server gate without a DB call. local-inventory
**reuses that claim** — it adds no new claim. (The server resolver still does a
per-request DB lookup; deduping it to read the claim is #1286's tracked boundary
follow-up, not this port's.)

**Interim role — strategic split is #1316's, not this port's.** The source's write
tier is `organization_manager`, which in the strategic two-role model (RB4,
[#1316](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1316)) becomes a
distinct **`ORG_MANAGER`** (the catalog side becomes `CATALOG_MANAGER`). This port
**collapses onto the single interim `INVENTORY_MANAGER`** #1286 introduces, so it
neither adds a role nor closes #1316. When #1316 lands, local-inventory's write
gate would move from `INVENTORY_MANAGER` → `ORG_MANAGER` — a small,
mechanical follow-up tracked against #1316, called out here so the interim choice
is on the record.

**Least-privilege note** (`docs/rules/principles.md`): the viewer gate *widens*
read access — a broad set of staff can read all org inventory (on-hand counts,
locations, logs). Deliberate and proportionate: inventory is operational
reference data, tiered `public`/`internal` with **no `pii`** (§5), so a wide read
audience exposes no personal data; write access stays narrow
(`INVENTORY_MANAGER`). The widening is confined to non-personal operational data,
which is what least-privilege permits — stated so the decision is on the record.

### Org + user identity — one injected source, shared with catalog

Resolved by #1286 §6 — local-inventory **adopts the same decision, not a
variant**. The source's `orgId` came from the org-bearer token and the acting
user from the auth-server cookie; **both are retired**, and checkin has no `orgId`
concept (it *is* Treehouse). So:

- **Org identity from a checkin-owned `Org` registry table** — not an env scalar.
  checkin-app hosts the one process, so the `Org` table (`{ id, name, … }`) lives
  in **checkin's schema**; the Treehouse row is **seeded on the initial
  migration with a stable, well-known id** (deterministic across dev/prod so the
  stamped `org_id`s match everywhere). #1286 introduces and seeds this table —
  **local-inventory adds nothing here**, it only receives the injected accessor.
- **Injected as an accessor**, `org: getOrg(): OrgIdentity`, into
  `configureLocalInventory()`. Single-org returns the one seeded row; a future
  multi-org resolves the current org per request (session / tenant / route) —
  **same seam, no library change**. **No library reaches cross-DB into checkin's
  `Org` table** — checkin-app reads its own table and injects, so consistency is
  by injection, not shared reads. local-inventory and catalog receive the **same**
  injected id (required — §8's S5 events and `@@unique([orgId, gtin13])` line up
  across the two DBs only if the value is identical).
- **Keep `org_id`/`org_name` columns** (String) — they already match a registry
  id; single-org stamps every row with the one seeded org, multi-org fills them
  from the resolved accessor.
- **User ids → checkin `Person.id`**, supplied by the injected
  `InventoryPrincipal` (`getPrincipal()`), not a users table (the source's
  local-users table is gone with its auth). Attribution columns (`userId`,
  `username`, `proposedByUserId`, `resolvedByUserId`, `performedBy`,
  `performedByUsername`) store the injected principal's id + a username snapshot;
  no FK to checkin (separate DB).

Both org and user identity flow through the single `configureLocalInventory()`
injection — one source per process.

## 7. UI — reskin in place

All UI lives in the library (`packages/local-inventory/src/{components,pages}`);
checkin-app only re-exports pages (§3) and wires nav (see Nav placement). Same
Mantine version → component-level reskin, not a rewrite. **Keep the source's
`"use client"` + `/api/*` pattern** (matches checkin; #1286 §7).

Eight pages, each an A12 surface / exception screen:

- `org-inventory` — OrgItem list + quantity edit (surface 1/2).
- `locations` — create / rename / reassign (surface 1); backed by `LocationLog`.
- `receive-queue` — pending receipts, fulfill action (surface 2).
- `received-inventory-deltas` — applied S3 deltas + failures (surface 2 audit).
- `inventory-merge-conflicts` **exception screen** — uom_mismatch resolution
  queue (surface 3).
- `provisional-part-map` / `provisional-items` — provisional resolution view
  (surface 4).
- `org-events` — the polled catalog org-events ledger (surface 4;
  `received-org-events`). **local-inventory is the org-facing consumer that
  surfaces these** — workflow-mapping deliberately does not (BYDESIGN, §10).
- `system-data` — settings (`SettingsData`: poll interval/window, global server
  URL). **org identity is not here** (it comes from the injected `Org` accessor,
  §6). Every field is **dead on arrival**: `pollInterval*` had a timer that no
  longer exists (S5 is in-process push, §8a); `globalServerUrl` pointed at the old
  catalog server that local-inventory no longer calls (catalog reads are
  in-process, §8b). Keep the row (harmless, model ports cleaner intact); drop the
  fields with the track-8 cleanup rather than wiring UI to them.

Drop the source `AppShell`/nav shell; pages render inside checkin's shell. Wire
auth via `useSession` client-side + the checkin session in the route handlers.

### Nav placement — join the Inventory area, don't add a top-level

#1286 §7 establishes checkin's two nav layers and creates **one top-level
`Inventory` entry** in `AppFrame.tsx`'s `NAV_ITEMS`, explicitly forward-looking:
"catalog is the first Inventory surface; more arrive as the migration proceeds."
**local-inventory is those "more."**

- **No second top-level entry.** local-inventory adds its screens as **more
  section tabs** (`NavLink[]`, rendered by `SectionTabs`) under the **existing**
  `Inventory` top-level item, appended to that section's tab array. The library
  exports its `NavLink[]` descriptor; checkin-app places it (order is a
  checkin-shell concern).
- The catalog's tabs (Items, Categories, Proposals, Conversion Challenges) and
  local-inventory's tabs (Org Inventory, Locations, Receive Queue, Merge
  Conflicts, Provisional, Org Events, …) live side by side under one `Inventory`
  section. Whether that becomes a long single tab row or the section grows
  sub-grouping is a checkin-shell UI call, not this port's — the port just
  contributes its `NavLink[]`.
- **Gate: `catalog-viewer` / `isCatalogViewerClient`** (reused verbatim, §6) — the same broad gate as
  the catalog tabs, broader than the board-only `*-Ops` items. Intended.
- **Badges** (e.g. open merge-conflicts / provisional count) use checkin's
  existing `navBadges` keyed on the tab href — optional, not first-landing. A
  server-sourced count crosses `handler()`'s stripper via the **synthetic
  public-scalar classification** pattern (#1286 Track-5) — same mechanism as the
  count endpoint (§11 track 5), not an envelope workaround.

---

## 8. Upstream couplings — three crossings (two inbound, one read)

local-inventory is a **terminal SINK** in the E-PIPELINE: two crossings flow
**into** it (S5 events, §8a; S3 apply, §8c) — these are what make it a sink. A
third is an outbound **read** (§8b): it reads catalog item data to display and
resolve its stock. All three must be designed explicitly, using the **same
per-crossing rule #1286 §8 set**:
*keep the JSON/contract shapes; convert transport, not architecture; every
crossing sits behind a port with an `http` adapter (today) and an `in-process`
adapter (after co-residence); converting a crossing = swap one adapter binding in
`configureLocalInventory()`, zero call-site churn; trigger = co-residence.*

### Crossing archetypes (from the source)

| Crossing | Direction | Kind | Contract | Today's transport |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S5 org-events** — provisional resolution events (`provisional_approved` / `_rejected` / `_mapped_to_existing`) | **catalog → local-inventory** | **async outbox — consumer side** | shared S5 union (`parseOrgEvent`, `@inventory/receipt-types`) | catalog's OrgEvent table, **HTTP-polled** by `startOrgEventsPoller`, persisted to local `received_org_events`, reacted to via `provisionalItemService` |
| **Catalog item reads** — item list + single-item lookup (display / resolution) | **local-inventory → catalog** | **synchronous read — consumer side** | catalog item shape | local-inventory's `/api/global-catalog/items*` routes **proxy** to the old catalog server (`globalServerUrl` + `signOrgToken` → catalog's `/api/catalog/items`) |
| **S3 delta-apply + provisional/enqueue** — `inventory/apply`, `provisional-items`, `receive-queue`, `GET org-items` | **workflow-mapping orchestrator → local-inventory** | **synchronous RPC — callee side** | `ResolvedInventoryDeltaSchema` (org-bearer) + the `/api/internal/*` zod schemas (service-key) | `POST /api/inventory/apply` (org-bearer) and `POST/GET /api/internal/[...path]` (X-Service-Key) |

These convert **differently** — that is the whole point of deciding now.

### 8a. catalog → local-inventory (S5, item #4 — provisional resolution)

**This is async and stays async** (#1286 §8 rule 4). The outbox — durable events,
in-transaction write on the catalog side, retry/ordering/audit, and
local-inventory's own `received_org_events` ledger + `received-org-event` xstate
machine — has value independent of transport. The consumer reacts by calling
`provisionalItemService.{approveProvisional,rejectProvisional,mapProvisionalToExisting}`,
which does the org-item merge and **parks a `uom_mismatch` `InventoryMergeConflict`**
when the provisional's counted conversion factor ≠ the resolved real item's factor
(surface 3, the exception screen — see `mergeOrgItems`).

**Conversion at co-residence — and why there is no in-app timer.** catalog lands
first (#1286), so it is co-resident from local-inventory's **first day**. There is
therefore **no remote producer to poll** — and the source's time-based
`setInterval` poller must **not** be carried across. An in-app interval poller
would keep the Node event loop busy forever (never-idle container), wake every N
minutes with no traffic, duplicate-poll across replicas, and fight a clean
SIGTERM. The async seam stays; the **trigger** changes from "poll on a timer" to
"drain on an in-process signal." Concretely the in-process adapter is:

- **Boot catch-up drain** — one-shot on startup: drain any `OrgEvent` rows written
  while this process was down (crash recovery). No timer.
- **Drain-on-emit** — catalog's `emitOrgEvent`, **after it commits** the
  `OrgEvent` row, fires an in-process signal through the injected port; the
  consumer drains **all pending rows for that org** (not just the just-written
  one — so a sibling replica's writes are swept too). No timer.
- **Bounded per-row retry** on a failed drain (backoff on the row); a stuck row is
  re-attempted by the next emit-drain. **No periodic sweep** — events keep
  arriving, so the next emit is the retry clock. Add a long-interval safety sweep
  **only** if a real stuck-row gap appears, and if so run it on checkin's
  **external scheduler** (the existing cron/Lambda infra), never an in-app
  `setInterval` — so the container is still poked from outside, not self-woken.

Everything durable stays: the `OrgEvent` outbox rows, local `received_org_events`
ledger, ordering, and the `assertTransition` guard. Only the wall-clock timer is
gone.

- Keep the shared S5 union (`parseOrgEvent`) as the contract in both modes.
- The `http`/poll adapter exists in the port **only** as the fallback shape for a
  *remote* producer. Since catalog is co-resident from day one, **local-inventory
  ships the in-process push adapter and never ships an in-app interval poller.**
  Land the consumer **inert** (drain wired but the catalog producer not yet
  emitting) until catalog actually emits, per #1286 §8's inert-consumer note.

**Port shape** (`contract.ts`): `CatalogEventSource` with `drainPending(orgId)`
(sweep + apply) plus a `subscribe(onEmit)` the producer calls post-commit; the
`in-process` adapter binds `onEmit` to catalog's emit hook, and `drainPending`
reads catalog's OrgEvent rows via the catalog library service (both DBs in one
process — a direct call into `@inventory/global-catalog`, not a cross-DB join).
The retained `pollSince(cursor)` shape is the remote/`http` fallback only.
local-inventory imports the port, never `@inventory/global-catalog` directly —
checkin injects the bound adapter and, in `configureLocalInventory()`, runs the
boot drain.

**Preserve these BYDESIGN behaviors** (do not "fix" in the port):
- `conversion_challenge_*` events are **not** consumed / not back-propagated
  (forward-only shrinkflation semantics; BYDESIGN). The poller's `default: break`
  stays.
- Provisional-approval quantity imprecision (UNFINISHED #5): a provisional's
  stock counted at factor 1 vs. the real item's canonical factor is reconciled by
  the **uom_mismatch merge-conflict path**, not by silent rescaling. Keep it.

### 8b. local-inventory → catalog (item reads — in-process, no repoint)

The source reads catalog item data (list + single lookup) to display and resolve
its org-items: `local-inventory-app/src/app/api/global-catalog/items*` **proxy**
to the old catalog server — `orgSettingsService.globalServerUrl` + a minted
`signOrgToken` → catalog's `GET /api/catalog/items` (+ `/[gtin13]`). #1286 §8's
Track-4 finding names local-inventory as exactly this remote consumer, and notes
those org-bearer reads live under catalog's **`/api/internal`** (not the human
`/api/catalog/*`) in checkin, with a one-line `pathPrefix` repoint for **still-
remote** consumers.

**For checkin's local-inventory that repoint is moot — it reads catalog
in-process.** Catalog is co-resident from day one (dependency gate, §1), so:

- Add a **`CatalogReader` port** (`contract.ts`: `listItems()`, `getItem(gtin13)`)
  bound in `configureLocalInventory()` to the **in-process** catalog library
  service — a direct call into `@inventory/global-catalog`, **no HTTP, no
  `globalServerUrl`, no `signOrgToken`**. It never touches catalog's `/api/catalog/*`
  *or* `/api/internal/items` — the human/machine route split (#1286 §7/§8) is an
  HTTP concern local-inventory sidesteps by reading the service.
- The source's `/api/global-catalog/items*` proxy routes are **dropped** (or become
  thin re-reads of the port for any UI that still fetches a local path). `signOrgToken`
  / `@inventory/auth` go with the retired auth (§6); `SettingsData.globalServerUrl`
  is dead (§7) — it pointed at the old catalog server, which local-inventory no
  longer calls.
- `http` fallback exists in the port only for a hypothetical remote catalog; since
  catalog lands first it is never bound here.

So the repoint #1286 tracks for *other* still-remote consumers does not apply to
checkin's local-inventory. (Only the **old** local-inventory-app server, if it
runs remote during overlap before this port lands, still hits the old catalog
server — that is #1286's follow-up, not this design's surface.)

### 8c. workflow-mapping orchestrator → local-inventory (S3, apply surface)

**This is synchronous RPC, and local-inventory is the callee.** The orchestrator
(CI4, #1289 — **out of scope here**; only its calls *into* local-inventory are in
scope) drives the "apply / retry-apply / proceed" surface. local-inventory
**exposes** it. The contract local-inventory must preserve:

The contract (payload shapes preserved as the in-process port's types; the source
routes/auth are shown for reference — checkin hosts none of them, §8c):

| Operation | Source route | Payload contract | Source auth (not hosted in checkin) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **apply / retry-apply delta** | `POST /api/inventory/apply` | `ResolvedInventoryDeltaSchema` (`orgId`, `receiptId`, `retailer?`, `lineItems[]` with `gtin13`, `quantityDelta`, `isDelayed`, `lineItemId`, `isProvisional`, `provisionalName`, `conversionFactor`, `conversionVersion`) | org-bearer |
| **apply (service variant)** | `POST /api/internal/inventory/apply` | `ApplyInventorySchema` (items[]) | X-Service-Key |
| **create provisional** | `POST /api/internal/provisional-items` | `ProvisionalItemSchema` | X-Service-Key |
| **enqueue receive** | `POST /api/internal/receive-queue` | `ReceiveQueueSchema` | X-Service-Key |
| **read org-item** | `GET /api/internal/inventory/org-items/:gtin13?orgId=` | — | X-Service-Key |

**Idempotency is part of the contract, not an implementation detail.** `apply`
upserts `ReceivedInventoryDelta` keyed on `receiptId` and re-applies — a re-push
of the same `receiptId` is a safe retry (that is *why* the orchestrator can
"retry-apply"). Preserve this exact idempotent shape when the transport flips.

**checkin cannot host this as an HTTP machine surface — #1286 §8 Track-4
finding.** The source guards it with `requireOrgBearer` (org-bearer) / an
`X-Service-Key`, and #1286 found checkin has **no sanctioned way to land a new
machine-bearer route**: (1) `requireOrgBearer`/`@inventory/web-auth` is retired
(§6) with no checkin-side org-bearer validator; (2) checkin's
`authenticateRequest`/`handler()` pipeline has no org-bearer/service-key auth path
and the registry `authorize` grammar can't express one; (3)
`scripts/legacy-authz-routes.txt` is frozen; (4) a new `src/app/api/internal/…`
route trips `check-route-coverage`'s `new-route-old-authz` ratchet (blocking). So
the inbound `/api/internal/*` + org-bearer `/api/inventory/apply` surface **cannot
be hosted in checkin as-is** — same wall the catalog machine surface hit.

**Unlike catalog, local-inventory cannot lean on "the old server carries it during
overlap."** The migration **moves the write target**: once org-items live in
checkin's inventory DB, a remote orchestrator pushing apply to the *old*
local-inventory server would split-brain the stock. So the apply crossing must be
**in-process, from a co-resident orchestrator** — it does not survive a remote
producer.

**Resolution — apply is in-process only; sequence it with the orchestrator.**

- When workflow-mapping (CI4) co-resides, bind the **in-process** adapter — the
  orchestrator imports `receiptService.applyReceipt` / `enqueueItem` /
  `createProvisional` **directly via the port**, no HTTP. Zod schemas stay the
  function param types. **Do not assume workflow-mapping "collapses away"** — only
  its transport changes; its calls into local-inventory are real and stay behind
  the port.
- **No inbound HTTP machine surface is built in checkin.** There is nothing to
  keep "live during overlap" and nothing to "retire last" (the earlier wording
  assumed checkin could host it — corrected per #1286).
- **Consequence for first landing:** the pipeline apply path is live **only once
  the orchestrator co-resides**. If a genuinely *remote* orchestrator must push
  apply into checkin before then, that needs a boundary PR extending checkin auth
  with a service-key/org-bearer inbound variant (#1286's option A) — a §12 open
  item, not first-landing work.

**Known concurrency hazard to carry across** (CONCURRENCY.md #2): concurrent
`fulfill` of one receive-queue item, and concurrent `apply` of one receipt, have
an unverified read-check-then-write race. The idempotency upsert covers the
sequential replay; the concurrent window is not proven closed. Track as a
**follow-up issue vs #1287** with a concurrent-drive test — do not silently
"fix" during the port (BYDESIGN discipline: write the failing concurrent test
first).

### First landing (local-inventory in; catalog in, receipt/orchestrator not yet)

- Reuse the temporary vendored `receipt-types` / `receipt-contract-fixtures`
  (#1286's copies).
- **S5 consumer**: bind the in-process catalog-events adapter but land the poller
  **inert** (flag-gated) until catalog emits provisional events; the local ledger
  + merge-conflict path are exercisable via seeded events / the catalog's own
  manual resolution routes.
- **S3 apply surface**: **not hosted over HTTP** (checkin can't; §8c). At first
  landing the pipeline apply path is dormant — the human UI, catalog reads (§8b),
  and S5 provisional consumption (§8a) all work, but receipt-driven apply only
  goes live when the orchestrator co-resides and calls in-process. Manual UI edits
  cover org-item/quantity setup until then. (Do **not** point a remote orchestrator
  at the old local-inventory server once checkin holds the data — it split-brains
  the stock, §8c.)

All temporary duplication is **< 2 weeks, dev-only** — acceptable, tracked.

---

## 9. Infra / deploy

Adds **no new service** — compiles into `checkin-app`'s build, ships in checkin's
existing container. Same as #1286 §9, plus:

- Build the new `packages/*` (`local-inventory`, and `org-events-poller` once the
  S5 consumer lands, `utils` if a track pulls it in); the workspace build already
  covers `packages/*`.
- **Provision the dedicated inventory database** + `LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL`
  secret (monitoring-db pattern in the Infra database module).
- **Org registry** — the checkin-owned `Org` table + its seeded Treehouse row
  (stable id) are **#1286's** deploy artifact (§6); already present once catalog
  lands. local-inventory adds no env and no seed here — it receives the injected
  `org` accessor at boot.
- Add **inventory `prisma migrate deploy`** (against `LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL`)
  to the deploy sequence, ordered with checkin's and catalog's migration steps.
- **S5 consumer lifecycle**: **no background timer** (§8a). A one-shot boot
  catch-up drain runs from `instrumentation.ts` / `configureLocalInventory()` in
  the server runtime only (never during `next build`); thereafter the consumer is
  woken by catalog's in-process emit signal. Nothing keeps the event loop awake
  between events, so idle CPU is zero and SIGTERM is clean. Safe under N replicas
  (each boot-drains; drain-on-emit sweeps all pending rows for the org).
- No new Caddy route, no new port, no new container.

---

## 10. Testing

Same posture as #1286 §10:

- **Keep vitest** — `local-inventory` is a `packages/` package (jest is
  checkin-app's convention, not the packages'). No jest conversion.
- **Unit tier ports ~verbatim; the source's route+auth-bound integration tier
  becomes checkin FLOW tests** (#1286 Track-4/5 finding). Source **unit** tests
  (services/validation, no route/auth) port near-as-is (Track 1). The source's
  **integration** tests are route+auth-bound (its `app-compat` HTTP shim +
  `@inventory/auth` seeding), so they don't port near-verbatim — in checkin that
  coverage **is flow tests** (route+auth+DB e2e over HTTP with persona-mint),
  which land in **track 5**, not a separate integration rewrite. The apply-path
  journeys those cover can only run once the orchestrator co-resides (§8c) or via
  a seeded in-process apply.
- **CI wiring — mostly already there** (#1286 Track-1 finding): the root
  `test:packages` script globs `npm run test -w ./packages --if-present`, so this
  package's vitest runs **automatically** — no new root script or CI job. The one
  wiring needed: add the inventory client generation to `db:generate:test` (run by
  `pretest:packages`). **Ops gotcha** (project memory): the inventory DB
  integration tier **silently skips unless `DOCKER_HOST` reaches the container
  runtime** — a green run isn't coverage otherwise.
- **Security tests**: registry/stripper coverage for inventory routes lives in
  `checkin-app/src/security/__tests__` (jest — checkin-app boundary wiring).
  Companion to the boundary PR (track 3).
- **e2e = flow tests, not Playwright.** checkin has no Playwright; the source's
  Playwright specs (`e2e/`) are **re-expressed as `flow-tests/*.flow.test.ts`** —
  real HTTP journeys against a running dev server. Priority journey: **A12 end to
  end** — enqueue → fulfill → apply delta → provisional resolution → uom_mismatch
  merge-conflict → resolve. Land in track 5.
- **Coupling tests**: the three ports (§8) get contract tests — for the in-process
  adapters (§8a catalog events, §8b catalog reads, §8c apply) that they behave
  identically to the source's HTTP shapes for the same input — the cheapest guard
  that a transport flip is behavior-preserving.
- **Concurrency**: the CONCURRENCY.md #2 fulfill/apply race is a **tracked
  follow-up** (§8c), not blocking the port.

---

## 11. Phasing (PR tracks)

**Dependency gate:** local-inventory implementation **follows the global-catalog
library (#1286)** — catalog is the upstream producer of the S5 events
local-inventory consumes, and local-inventory reuses catalog's vendored packages
(§2). Track 1 below can start once #1286 track 1 (catalog library skeleton +
`packages/gtin,workflows,receipt-types`) has landed.

1. **Library skeleton** — `packages/local-inventory`: inventory schema + client +
   migrations (port the six), domain services/repositories/workflows ported,
   **unit tests only** (the source's route+auth-bound integration tier → flow tests
   in track 5, §10). **Rename the source `ProvisionalItem` model →
   `InventoryProvisionalItem`** (`@@map` keeps the table) and update every library
   consumer — required to avoid the merged-classifications collision with catalog;
   it is a Track-1 change that must land **with/before** the Track-3 boundary PR
   (§4). Package stays `next`-free. **No new shared packages here** —
   reuses #1286's `packages/{gtin,workflows,receipt-types}`; `org-events-poller`
   and `utils` are **not imported by any Track-1 file** (confirmed in build), so
   they defer (`org-events-poller` → track 6 with the S5 consumer; `utils` → the
   track that first needs it), §2. No UI, no checkin wiring. Green in isolation.
2. **Roles — done as a reuse decision** (`claude/nostalgic-wilbur-ddc7e8`).
   **None new**: `INVENTORY_MANAGER` + the `hasVolunteerDesignation` claim already
   on the base (untouched); inventory read-eligibility verified ≡ catalog's, so it
   **reuses `catalog-viewer` / `isCatalogViewerClient` verbatim — no
   `isInventoryViewer*` fork** (forward-ref comment at the predicate). Folds into
   track 4; no separate PR. (When #1316 lands, a mechanical follow-up moves writes
   → `ORG_MANAGER`; §6.)
3. **Security boundary** — `@sensitivity` annotations, `generator security` for
   the inventory schema (cross-package wiring, §5), registry route entries,
   **two `OPT_OUT_PENDING_ROUTE` entries** (`InventoryLog`/`LocationLog`, whose
   bare `userId` is scopable), **zero scopeBindings** (§5). Extend the
   `security-boundary-isolation` workflow's `is_companion` to accept the
   `packages/local-inventory` schema as a companion (§5 CI gap) — else this PR is
   flagged. Own PR track, **registry-first**. **Optional here (and only here):**
   if an inventory-named read gate is wanted for call-site clarity, add an
   `inventory-viewer` resolver alias in the boundary layer
   (`core.ts`/`access-resolvers.ts`) — a deliberate boundary decision, not a
   track-4 route change; default is to reuse `catalog-viewer` (§6).
4. **Routes + auth + seams** — library route factories + a next-free
   `src/routes/_shared.ts` (parse/validate via injected `httpError`, no
   `next/server` — the source `validate` is not ported) + `contract.ts` (the three
   crossing ports: `CatalogEventSource` §8a, `CatalogReader` §8b, the apply port
   §8c) + `configureLocalInventory` wired in `instrumentation.ts`; **human**
   `/api/…` stubs (`authorize: 'catalog-viewer'` read / `INVENTORY_MANAGER` write —
   reused, §6/track 2) + security guards; drop
   the source `/api/global-catalog/items*` proxy routes (§8b). **The machine
   surface (`/api/internal/*`, org-bearer `/api/inventory/apply`) is NOT built —
   checkin can't host it (§8c); apply is in-process only.** Watch the
   route-endpoint-string gotcha (§5). Human list routes return bare model-bag
   arrays (pagination → track 5). Depends on 1–3 (and, for `CatalogReader`, on
   #1286's catalog service being importable).
5. **UI + nav + flow tests + pagination** — reskinned pages/components (library),
   page stub tree + `pageRegistry` entries, the library's `NavLink[]` **appended to
   the existing `Inventory` section tabs** #1286 created (no new top-level entry —
   §7), `transpilePackages` (if tsx needs it — verify). **Flow tests carry the
   source's integration journeys** (route+auth+DB e2e via persona-mint), incl. the
   A12 journey. **Numbered pagination where a list needs it** (inventory-log
   especially) via the #1286 Track-5 pattern — a `.../count` endpoint enabled by a
   registry-first boundary commit declaring a synthetic **public count response
   model** so the scalar total passes the stripper (a bare model-bag can't carry a
   total). Not offset+lookahead. Apply per-list, only where the volume warrants it.
6. **S5 consumer** — bind the in-process catalog-events adapter (push-driven, §8a:
   boot drain + drain-on-emit, **no timer**); wired from `instrumentation.ts`,
   inert until catalog emits. Requires #1286's `emitOrgEvent` to expose the
   post-commit signal hook the consumer subscribes to. Depends on 1–4 and on
   #1286's catalog producer being co-resident.
7. **Infra** — deploy sequence + DB provisioning.
8. **(Deferred — each a tracked follow-up issue vs #1287, not prose "later")**
   retire the HTTP `http`-adapter routes when receipt-app / workflow-mapping
   co-reside and flip to in-process; the concurrency #2 fulfill/apply race test +
   fix; UNFINISHED #5 provisional-quantity auto-correction (currently the
   uom_mismatch queue is the accepted interim). File these at merge.

## 12. Open items

Only genuinely open work lives here. Resolved decisions are recorded in the
sections they belong to (§1–§11) and are **not** recapped here — org/user identity
(§1/§6), the in-process apply + no-hosted-machine-surface decision (§8c), catalog
reads in-process with no repoint (§8b), the push-driven no-timer consumer (§8a),
roles/viewer gate (§6), DB/security/nav/testing (§4/§5/§7/§10). Nothing there is
a STOP-AND-ASK; there is no hard blocker for first landing.

### Open follow-ups (file as GitHub issues referencing #1287 at merge)

- **`emitOrgEvent` signal hook — cross-doc dependency on #1286.** The push-driven
  S5 consumer (§8a) needs #1286's `emitOrgEvent` to expose a post-commit in-process
  signal the consumer subscribes to. If #1286 ships without it, add it there (its
  own PR) **before track 6**. This is the one live dependency, not just a deferral.
- **Remote-orchestrator apply — boundary PR only if sequencing forces it (§8c).**
  Apply is in-process only. If local-inventory ever lands while the orchestrator is
  still remote, checkin needs a service-key/org-bearer inbound auth variant (#1286
  option A). Preferred: sequence apply to co-reside with CI4 so this never arises.
- **Concurrency: fulfill/apply race (§8c; CONCURRENCY.md #2).** Unverified
  read-check-then-write window on concurrent fulfill / concurrent apply. File a
  concurrent-drive test (write the failing test first) + fix if real.
- **Track 8 deferrals:** UNFINISHED #5 provisional-quantity auto-correction (the
  uom_mismatch queue is the accepted interim); drop the dead `SettingsData` poll
  fields (§7); browser-only UI test coverage if a real gap appears (§10).

**Deferral discipline:** each of the above is filed as a tracked issue at merge —
never a bare "later" in prose or a code comment. The issue tracker remembers, not
this doc.

### Assumptions

- **No production inventory to migrate; loaded by pipeline + hand.** No existing
  data to import and no direct bulk-import endpoint (the source has none). The real
  load path is **receipt-replay** — replaying stored receipts (TOPDOWN GC-INVENTORY
  Q22/Q30) through the orchestrator → apply/enqueue surface (§8c), which arrives
  when receipt-app co-resides; manual UI edits cover setup until then.
- **Dev/test seed to build.** No reusable seed exists — lift the baseline
  locations/org-items/receive-queue shape from Inventory's
  `scripts/setup-test-data.sh` (drop its curl + retired-auth transport; write via
  the inventory Prisma client against `LOCAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE_URL`), and add
  `VolunteerDesignation` rows (seed has **0**) so the viewer gate and pages are
  exercisable.
- **Seed org-id agreement.** The catalog and inventory seeds must stamp rows with
  the **same** injected `Org` id (§6) and agree on the GTINs a provisional resolves
  to, so the S5 merge path is exercisable end-to-end.

## 13. Distillation at merge (`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §4)

This doc lives in `docs/in-design/` — **deleted at merge**. Planned split, so the
extract step is a file move (not a months-later judgement call over every
paragraph, §4.2). Content splits three ways:

**(1) Standing domain rules → new register file `docs/rules/inventory.md`.**
On-hand holdings are a new domain the eight existing register files don't cover;
#1286 §13 explicitly reserves `inventory.md` for exactly this, kept distinct from
`catalog.md` (the reference/definitional domain — *what items are* — vs. this one,
*what we hold*). Create it **at merge**, not before (empty-in-advance is
forbidden, §3). Written as Policy / Assumptions / Procedure — decisions and
invariants only, no mechanism. Ask §3.9 of each (*could a later change violate
this?*); seeds that qualify:
- **Access invariant:** on-hand inventory is operational reference data, **no
  PII**; **read** = broad viewer gate (any RBAC role / program leader /
  volunteer), **write** = `INVENTORY_MANAGER` — cite `principles.md`
  least-privilege (§6).
- **Org-stamping invariant:** every row carries the one injected org identity
  (§6).
- **Apply idempotency invariant:** a receipt-driven apply is keyed on `receiptId`
  and safely re-appliable (that is what makes "retry-apply" correct) — §8c.
- **Shrinkflation is forward-only:** a conversion-factor change is **never**
  back-propagated to already-counted stock; a provisional/real factor mismatch is
  **parked as a `uom_mismatch` merge-conflict** for a human, not auto-rescaled
  (BYDESIGN; §8a).
- **Apply is in-process, not a hosted endpoint:** checkin hosts no machine-bearer
  route; the receive/apply crossing is driven in-process by the co-resident
  orchestrator (§8c) — the decision, not the wiring.
- **Role decision:** writes use interim `INVENTORY_MANAGER`; strategic `ORG_MANAGER`
  split stays open in RB4 (cross-ref [#1316](https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/issues/1316)).

**(2) Architecture/ops reference that stays true → `docs/designs/LOCAL_INVENTORY.md`**
(§4 "operational reference → move, don't delete"). What later Inventory tracks
(receipt-app, CI4) rely on: the three-crossing **port model** and its in-process
adapters (events §8a, catalog read §8b, apply §8c), the **push-driven consumer**
(boot drain + drain-on-emit, no timer, §8a), own-DB / third-Prisma-client
packaging (§4), and the **machine-surface-not-hosted decision + the CI4
co-residence sequencing constraint** (§8c/§12). Runnable-ops bits (the dev seed
recipe, the `DOCKER_HOST` skip gotcha) go to `docs/ops/` if worth keeping.

**(3) Pure mechanism now in the code → deleted** with the working doc (route
mounting, stub tree, `NavLink[]` splice, `_shared.ts`, security-generator wiring,
handler-endpoint gotcha, poller drain wiring, test tiers, pagination mechanics) —
a reader derives it from the source (§3).

**Cross-doc note:** because catalog (#1286) distills first, its
`docs/rules/catalog.md` and `docs/designs/GLOBAL_CATALOG.md` will exist by the
time local-inventory merges. `inventory.md` **references** catalog rules (org
identity, the viewer gate, the shared crossing rule) rather than restating them.

---

*Design for #1287. Second app of the whole-Inventory migration; downstream of the
global catalog (#1286), which must land first. Temporary duplication at the
receipt-app / workflow-mapping boundaries is expected and tracked.*
