# Backlog Index (buckets)

> **Provenance:** validation evidence (chip outputs, file:line-cited code checks at base `5528270d`, raw GH dumps) lives in `backlog/sources/` on branch `claude/checkin-backlog-baseline-b0ef5a` — not copied here. Chip ids (V1–V7, A–H) and `sources/...` paths refer to that branch.

Status: **APPROVED baseline (v2, 2026-07-20).** Synthesized from all sources (chips A–F + D2),
deduped, bucketed, tagged. Buckets + coverage + readiness + GH associations signed off (Q5).
GH issues opened for every backlog item (2026-07-22): #1226–#1322 for the net-new set, plus pre-existing handles. Only `CM5` (external fix underway), `RB18` (anti-item, "do NOT port"), and `RB22` (open rename DECISION — may not be wanted) intentionally have no issue.

## Legend
- **Origin**: PORT (exists in an Inventory app) · CREATE (net-new) · ENHANCE (extend built checkin) · FIX (open bug) · DECISION (keep/kill or policy call)
- **Readiness** (design→dev pipeline state ONLY):
  - `NEEDS-DESIGN` · `IN-DESIGN` (doc exists, don't-start) · `READY-FOR-DEV` · `VERIFY` (needs code check) · `DECISION` (product/policy answer needed) · `COND` (genuinely gated on an external trigger — see note)
  - **NOTE:** "deferred from v1 launch" is NOT a readiness. Items cut from v1 scope are still wanted; their readiness reflects design/dev state, not the old launch call. Only `COND` marks a real trigger-gate (e.g. "adopt once unattended").
- **Src**: chip letter(s). **GH**: existing issue handle (open/closed) or `none`.
- **Size**: S/M/L/XL(epic). IDs are bucket-prefixed and stable for later reference.
- **Workaround**: the current manual workaround if the feature is missing (affects urgency). `?` = not yet assessed · `none` = no workaround, higher pain.

**When an item is confirmed done/built: DELETE its row** from the bucket table and add a one-liner to § Dropped — no struck-through or verbose "BUILT-DROP" rows (keeps the buckets clean).

Legend of drops: see [§ Dropped — confirmed built](#dropped--confirmed-built-not-backlog) and each source file in `sources/`.

## 1. Membership & Household  (prefix M)

| id | item | origin | readiness | size | Workaround | src | GH |
|----|------|--------|-----------|------|----|-----|-----|
| M1 | **Ongoing-membership status machine**: add GRACE + INACTIVE + scheduled active→grace→inactive (OrgMembership.status is NONE/ACTIVE/REVOKED/DENIED only). NOTE: distinct from the built `OrgMembershipProcess` *application/renewal* lifecycle (generated/lifecycle/membership.md, ends at ACTIVE/ARCHIVED) — this is the missing *ongoing* layer on top. Cross-link (PR #1197): the membership-sync's "lapse" removal = **manual revoke only until M1 lands** — 1197 states the dependency explicitly. | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | L | board tracks manually (QB/Shopify) | B,E,generated | #1152 (open, viz) |
| M2 | Membership **state-maintenance cron** (compliance eval + warn-only violations dashboard; never auto-terminate) | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | manual board review | B | #1226 (open) |
| M3 | Stale-application lifecycle (60d archive / 180d purge-if-never-active) | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | ? | B | #1227 (open) |
| M4 | **Archive Family** — #959 **proposed** a thin first cut (single `archivedAt` stamp + shared active-filter + write-guards + board toggle) but was **closed unmerged (2026-08-05) — nothing shipped**; `Household.archivedAt` is not on `main` (branch retained for the design). Interview (PR #959) rework: model **TWO archive states as DB state, not text** — **Form A INVALID/DUPLICATE** (terminal, never reactivates, almost always follows a person-merge = "M18 wearing an archive costume"; NOT a purge — keep all history/audit) vs **Form B IDLE/AGED-OUT** (reactivatable on re-login). Add a **no-active-items precondition** + specific cleanup list, **state-aware self-reactivation**, and archive that **actively unsubscribes lists** / un-archive that does **NOT** auto re-add (ties SYNC-2, CM4). #959's proposed single-state block-all guards conflict with the reactivation model | CREATE | IN-DESIGN | M | ? | B,PR#959(closed-unmerged) | #1228 (open) |
| M5 | Cascading removal on revoke/deny (pull enrollments + pickup auths + list subs). NOTE (PR #965): the cascade design does **enrollments only** — the **pickup-authorization cascade leg is not addressed**; list-subs = CM4 | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | remove enrollments/subs by hand | B | #1229 (open) |
| M6 | Age-based **individual agreement per ≥18 child** (child-of-signer, not spouse) — today one household-level agreement. NOTE (PR #1328): needs a **family-facing "why this + what to do" surface** for the two false-positive edges — graduating senior flagged a cycle late, and spouse-vs-child can't be told apart in data (message: ignore, or mark spouse a lead); copy+placement TBD | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | ? | B,E | #1224 (open) |
| M7 | "Students ≥18 as of Sept 1" report — current AND next member-year | CREATE | READY-FOR-DEV | S | none | B | #1230 (open) |

| M16 | BLOCKED membership — **PARTIAL**: the alert is fixed (`MembershipFlowStepper` shows "needs attention, team notified" — board-override-only). Remaining: right-column status card (`page.tsx:985-992`) has NO BLOCKED case → still shows the generic #879 "follow the steps" card, now CONTRADICTING the alert. Add an `inStatus==="BLOCKED"` branch. **#879 closed but never fixed.** | FIX | READY-FOR-DEV | S | the red alert already tells them (card just contradicts) | D2,verify | #879 (closed — NOT fixed) |
| M19 | **Hide archived households from the many views** that don't filter them yet (follow-on to M4/#959 soft-archive — archive blocks activity but many read surfaces still show archived families). #959 **proposed** an `ACTIVE_HOUSEHOLD_WHERE`/`_PERSON_WHERE` shared filter as the reuse vehicle, but #959 **closed unmerged — no such helper exists on `main`**, so #1232 must build the shared active-filter itself (nothing to reuse). | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | ? | owner,PR#959(closed-unmerged) | #1232 (open) |
| M20 | **View membership agreement as PDF, view-only** — read the agreement without triggering a Zoho Sign session (applicants previewing before committing + members re-reading their reference copy). Design calls: static current-template PDF vs the person's own signed copy (Zoho download); ties CM12 templates + CM13 policy library | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | ask board / start-then-abandon a Zoho sign flow | owner | #1233 (open) |
| M21 | **Alumni pipeline** (Q74): students age out → alumni relationship worth modeling — keep the door open for the classic alumni→mentor return (list membership, status distinct from lapsed member, SA1 BG trigger already fires when they return as adults). Scope TBD | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | nothing — alumni just disappear | owner | #1234 (open) |
| M22 | **Application archive/restore must record destroyed state at archive time, not infer it** — DESIGN FLAW (rules-fold): restore today walks the audit log for the archiving entry and reads the prior state out of it; a pruned log or a reshaped audit record leaves an application that cannot be put back. Capture the collapsed state when the archive decision is taken. | FIX | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | ? | rules-fold | #1430 (open) |
| M23 | **Don't re-prompt a household that deliberately shares one contact address** (rules-fold) — a single shared address between members is a deliberate answer, not a missing second contact; intake/validation must not treat it as an omission. Ties the RB10 "≥1 reachable contact" floor. | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | ? | rules-fold | #1431 (open) |
| M24 | **Require a name on every Person; retire the kiosk email-prefix fallback** (rules-fold) — the kiosk shows the local-part of an email when a person has no name recorded; requiring a name on Person removes the need for that fallback entirely. | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | kiosk shows email-prefix | rules-fold | #1432 (open) |
| M25 | **Youth school-enrollment status is not captured** (policy divergence; moved Programs→Membership) — POLICY SHORTFALL: policy requires a youth without a high-school diploma or equivalent to be enrolled in school; the app has no field for it, so the requirement cannot be checked. | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | ? | divergence | #1442 (open) |

| P14 | **Checkin → public Google Calendar feed** (Q83): programs/events created here publish to the website's Google Calendar. MUST include **display rules for cancellations + last-minute moves** (weather reactions etc.) so the public view never gaslights people — a changed event shows AS changed, not silently swapped. (Parked PR #952 CLOSED → its narrow .ics-export slice is tracked separately as #1360; P14 here is the full live feed.)

| P19 | Program-date **time display** off-by-one (UTC/local) — **a slice of PL17** (the broader date/time remediation). **SHIPPED**: the program display sites read the stored day unshifted, the writers store a day rather than a moment, and the columns are now `date`. Dropped from the backlog; the rest of the class stays open as PL17. | FIX | READY-FOR-DEV | S | ? | F | #1149 (open) |

Reuses program↔Shopify variant + webhook plumbing | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M–L | manual order collection + side spreadsheet to vendor | owner | #1246 (open) |
| P24 | **Treehouse-wide / cross-program events** — an org-level event can appear on one or MORE program calendars (e.g. library visit with reps of 3 teams). Breaks the event-belongs-to-one-program assumption → event↔program many-to-many or org-event + program associations; affects attendance association + who's notified/RSVPs. Model it inside the P1 restructure rather than bolt-on; ties P14 calendar | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | duplicate the event per program by hand | owner | #1247 (open) |

Phase 1: per-program **links to external registration** + P22-style gap dashboard ("enrolled here, not registered there"). Phase 2 ambition: **sync/expose FIRST registration state** in checkin. Texas wrinkle: students AND mentors must register with FIRST-NH **and** FIRST-Texas — two external registrations per person | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | chase families by email, track in heads | owner | #1249 (open) |
| P27 | **Trip mode — temporary access expansion for off-site events** (Q44/Q54): during a trip window, chaperones/leads get the P20 roster surface incl **emergency contacts + allergies** on their phone; access is time-boxed to the event, then auto-revoked. Needs think-through (who grants, scope, audit). Ties P20, SA7, RB8 row-visibility | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | printed sheet in a binder | owner | #1250 (open) |
| P28 | **Program "requires signed waiver" feature** (Q61): a program can require a waiver signed at/for enrollment (summer camps are big enough to need one); gate enrollment on it + track who signed (Zoho pattern like the membership agreement). Trips explicitly do NOT need one (covered by membership agreement; non-members don't come). Ties CM12 templates | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | paper waivers in a folder | owner | #1251 (open) |
| P29 | **PL "paid?" reminder signal** — per-participant covered / in-process / reminder-due, derived from `ProgramParticipant.status` (NOT `FeePayment`); tier-gated to the PL band so full-pay/scholarship/plan stay indistinguishable. Split from FR7 (`docs/designs/PROGRAM_PAYMENT_VISIBILITY.md`); likely surfaces on the P20 My-Programs staff home; relates P13 | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | PL asks the treasurer / checks Shopify | F | #1336 (open) |
| P30 | **BUG — program-leader picker uses an 18+ age floor; policy requires 23** (rules-fold) — both leader-selection search paths admit anyone 18 or over; the leader role carries legal responsibility and its floor is 23. Volunteers are unaffected (no age floor, and must not gain one). | FIX | READY-FOR-DEV | S | screen leader candidates by hand | rules-fold | #1433 (open) |
| P31 | **A run may narrow enrolment eligibility but never widen it** (rules-fold) — price is set by the board on the program definition; a single instance/run may tighten an age range or a member-only restriction but may never loosen one. A constraint on the ProgramInstance model; `PROGRAM_INSTANCE_RESTRUCTURE.md` is its likely home. | CREATE | IN-DESIGN | M | ? | rules-fold | #1434 (open, ties P1) |
| P32 | **Enrolling in a priced-but-unsellable program must fail closed, not strand** — DESIGN FLAW (rules-fold): a program that carries a price with nothing wired to sell it currently admits the enrolment, then the seat sits PENDING indefinitely and payment never arrives; the app detects and reports the state but still lets the enrolment through. Reject at enrolment. Distinct from P13 (deliberately manual-only programs). | FIX | NEEDS-DESIGN | S | ? | rules-fold | #1435 (open) |
| P33 | **Program dates are optional; policy requires a start and a bounded end** (policy divergence) — POLICY SHORTFALL: both start and end can be absent and nothing rejects it. A start must be required; an absent end should fall to fiscal-year-end, not stay empty. While missing, three rules silently change meaning: (a) **age eligibility falls back to the request moment — the exact thing the age rule exists to avoid** (safety-adjacent); (b) the catalogue reads a missing end as running indefinitely; (c) member pricing falls back to status alone. | FIX | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | ? | divergence | #1441 (open) |

Who a flag reaches is still undecided (#1509). | CREATE | DONE | S | — | B,owner | #1256 (closed) |
| AT6 | **Two-deep compliance** (block last adult leaving lone student; 60s delay) — child-safety GAP. **POLICY SHORTFALL (divergence): the check counts raw adults present.** Policy requires **two adults who are volunteers, non-students, and unrelated / from different households**, present whenever any youth is, and must trigger on the drop **below two** — not only the last adult leaving (→0).

Includes a **bug**: 3s debounce swallows the 2nd badge so a fast keyholder double-badge can't close the facility (real window [3s,12s]); ties AT6/#300, AT9/#254.

## 4. Safety & Compliance  (prefix SA)

| id | item | origin | readiness | size | Workaround | src | GH |
|----|------|--------|-----------|------|----|-----|-----|
| SA3 | **Scheduled household-composition sweeps** — recompute BG/safety obligations as membership/ages change: (a) flag a household that has lost its only background-checked adult (NO_CHECKED_ADULT → youth now uncovered) — **POLICY SHORTFALL (divergence): detection only; today the household stays ACTIVE with youth enrolled and nothing responds, so it reads compliant. The response (block / grace / warning) is a DECISION (see DECISIONS)**; (b) when a youth turns 18, recompute their own BG/agreement obligations. Catches gaps that emerge over time, not just at intake. | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | ? | B,divergence | #1261 (open) |

Program-lead gets the **overdue-student SIGNAL** (the conversation is in-person, not modeled). Board needs a **"reset the timer" control** on the compliance screen (`/membership-audit/compliance`) for a mistaken self-attest — **PARTIAL landed (#1412: confirm BG attestations + "a way back" = the reset/undo path)**; the parallel board+lead escalation loop remains | ENHANCE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | ? | B,PR#961(closed-unmerged) | #1262 (open) |

| SA11 | **Volunteer-onset background-check trigger (per-adult)** (rules-fold) — **any adult who starts volunteering needs their OWN check AT THAT POINT** (per-adult; one person's check never satisfies another's), event-driven, off-cycle — not only at intake/renewal or the annual sweep. Membership itself needs only **ONE** checked adult in the household (that's a membership gate, separate); this is a **volunteer** obligation. So how many adults are checked follows **who volunteers — one or both**, not "both because a second volunteers." SA3's sweep is the periodic backstop; **depends on SA1/#1260** (the per-adult-stamp fix — until it lands, one adult's check falsely reads as another's, defeating this trigger). | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | no off-cycle trigger; caught late (or missed) by the annual sweep | rules-fold | #1429 (open) |
| SA12 | **Closing/departure guard must enforce two adults with a last youth, not keyholder-count** (policy divergence, youth-supervision) — POLICY SHORTFALL: the closing guard watches keyholders (last keyholder is stopped + made to confirm), so a NON-keyholder adult can leave a youth with only one remaining adult and nothing interrupts. Policy requires two adults on site whenever a youth is. Distinct from AT6 (guards the last adult →0, not the drop below two →1) and AT9 (force-close race). Reports the room compliant when it is not. | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | none — silent | divergence | #1436 (open) |
| SA13 | **Primary-keyholder model** (policy divergence; moved Facility→Safety) — POLICY SHORTFALL: policy has ONE primary keyholder at a time, transferable only with the other keyholder's consent, and a departing primary must either transfer or close. None of that is modelled — the app tracks keyholder presence/count only. | CREATE | NEEDS-DESIGN | M | handled by people, untracked | divergence | #1437 (open) |
| SA14 | **Second-adult-volunteer requirement is not a scheduling precondition** (policy divergence; moved Programs→Safety) — POLICY SHORTFALL: a session can be scheduled without the required second adult volunteer; policy makes it a precondition of scheduling.

The fix is the callers passing the org-zone calendar day as `asOf` — a day comes from a day — not a local-field read inside the helper; `calculateAge`'s own comment names the upgrade.

| RB22 | **`'member'` field-visibility TIER — rename to `orgMember` or bless as-is?** (UNFINISHED Phase-4 OQ-1) — the security *visibility* tier `'member'` (a typed access contract, `member`-view holds member+public) is a different axis from the org-membership noun and was deliberately left OUT of the Phase-4 rename. Open question whether a rename is even wanted (reads fine as "member-visible"). If done: ~34 `'member'` tokens in `registry.ts` scope arrays + one `@sensitivity:member` tag + generated classifications + parser guards — **partly tsc-blind**, needs the full jest security suite as the net (over/under-grant risk). Its own slice, low priority. | ENHANCE | DECISION | S | leave as-is (works) | UNFINISHED | none |

## Reverse coverage — open GH issues → backlog mapping

All 40 open issues are associated above **except** these, which are pure bugs/chores that don't merit a backlog *feature* (track as-is in GH), or are stale/close-candidates:

- **Closed by hand** (2026-07-20, audit-confirmed done): #237, #235, #160 — no longer tracked here.
- **Keep/kill decisions**: #354 (FR7), #975 (CO8).
- **Rescope**: #472 (CM11 — RSVP ripped out).
- Everything else maps to an item above (see GH column). No open issue is unaccounted-for.

## Near-term priority signals (from Q33 triage)

Owner-assigned relative priority. Not a schedule — a lean. Still high-level (discovery), no deep-dive committed.
- **A convergence candidate (not confirmed the priority):** the **receipt → catalog → inventory → QB** pipeline (GC-INVENTORY + GC-QB + expense port). Noted as a natural grouping, not an agreed center of gravity. See TOPDOWN.
- **Soon / near-top:** **M6** per-≥18-child agreement · **M1** board "who hasn't paid since Sept 1" dashboard · **SA6** delete-DOB for all adults (#1165) · **M15** enforce certifier ∈ member-family (#164, HIGH — certifier can grant tool use).
- **Short term:** **P1** program→instance restructure · **P4/#82** auto-close enrollment · **M13** settings-400 bug (#1130) · **M16** BLOCKED-recovery flow · **P14** program calendar load (Google Calendar).
- **Short–medium:** **P9** copy-program (#156) · **P13** manual-only-program flag (ops/leader manual-add bypassing Shopify cap).
- **Medium term:** **CO1** Shopify segment-pricing · **P2/P3** seat reservation + waitlist (#942) · **P10** member-visibility timing (#152) · **CO2/#278** honor-system discount / process-ID (exploiting it is an ethics violation → unlikely short-term).
- **Medium-ish, other-dev-owned** (may land in passing): comms — **CM11** event-cancel-notify (#472) · **CM8/CM9** program-email controls + batching (#1153/#1154).
- **Discuss / tee up:** **RB7** admin-role ambiguity (a decision conversation).
- **Soon, pending buy-in:** **RB8** declarative row-visibility (#1134) — owner advocating with others.
- **Needs real data first:** **AT1/AT2** attendance inference/ambiguity — assess with real data before scoping.
- **P7** Shopify↔capacity reconciliation — gap CONFIRMED (V2): comp-add path skips `adjustProgramInventory`. No longer "investigate"; it's real.
- **Lower:** **M2** state-maintenance cron (want the dashboard, not the cron) · **PL2** PII read-audit.
- **In-flight (lands ~this week):** **CM** mailing-list automation (fixes the email bug).
- **Parked:** **M9** corporate membership → Consciously not modeled.

## Parked partial PRs (post-first-release — scope sources, NOT done)

13 open `post-first-release` PRs are **done-ish but underspecified** (same disease as past PRs). **Mine for scope, do NOT treat as complete or merge-ready.** They show what someone already attempted for each item — input for the eventual issue-writing. Full detail: `sources/post_release_pr_map.md`. Several are *partial even as code*.

| INDEX item | parked PR | how complete (per PR body) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| M4 archive family | #959 (CLOSED unmerged) | nothing shipped (`archivedAt` not on main); interview reworked M4 to two-state (#1228) |
| M5 cascade removal | #965 (closed) | tracked as #1229 (enrollments only; pickup-auth leg open) |
| P5 program archive | #954 (closed) | tracked as #1236 |
| P6 Shopify auto-archive | #955 (closed) | tracked as #1237 (listing archive only; no empty-category warnings) |
| P14 calendar load | #952 (closed) | .ics slice tracked as #1360; full feed = #1242 |
| CM1 mailing-list sync | #960 (closed) | superseded by MEMBERSHIP_SYNC #1197 / #943 |
| PL4 time-scoped contact | #963 (OPEN) | interview re-cut PL4 (#1304) — theater vs old roster door |
| SA1 BG automation | #961 (OPEN) | student-nudge slice; #1260 now = the 🔴 per-adult-stamp safety defect (design PR-references it, no close) |
| P1 program→instance | #953 (closed) | phase-1 tracked as #1361 |

_Merge health: #960 + #1109 CONFLICTING (rebase); other 11 mergeable=UNKNOWN (GitHub hasn't recomputed — re-poll, not a clean signal)._

## Consciously not modeled (no real timeframe)

Deliberately parked — real concepts, but we do not intend to model them in any foreseeable timeframe.
Not dropped (they're valid), not backlog (no plan to build). Revisit only if priorities change.

| item | why parked | src |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **AT7** — age-based shop/tool state from who's present | No control point (system doesn't lock shop doors/tools) → tracking has no value. Distinct from two-deep (AT6, which IS in scope). | B,C · Q12 |
| **Capped↔uncapped Shopify auto-sync** — editing `Program.maxParticipants` ACROSS the null line (uncapped→cap, or cap→uncapped) | **Stays manual for now (owner, 2026-07-25).** `maxParticipants` = number (capped) or `null` (uncapped/sells-forever); the Shopify variant mirrors it via `inventory_management` ('shopify' vs `null`). They align at creation. The gap: an edit across the null line can't do the `newMax-oldMax` delta math (can't subtract `null`) AND needs Shopify's tracking flag flipped (start/stop tracking) + stock set/cleared — which the adjust-by-delta call doesn't do. Today: code detects it, **skips Shopify, logs a warning, tells the admin to fix by hand** (`route.ts:241-247`). Rarer path than comp-add (P7); warn-and-manual is acceptable. Auto-flip left unbuilt on purpose. | owner · P7-adjacent |
| **Repeat-donor CRM** — recurring-donor relationships, thank-yous, next-year asks | Heavily deferred (owner: "not in the next 2 years"). Intake/receipting IS in scope (FD1/FD3/FD6/FD7); the relationship layer is QB/Benevity's lane for now. | Q76 |
| **Machine-status comms** — "laser down this week" member notice | Too rare to build for. Heavily deferred. | Q82 |
| **Program Budgets** — budget lifecycle (draft→Board approve→carry-over/revert), incl. much of GC-FIN-CONTROL's budget layer | Very low priority; not painful. Expense/receipt→QB is the pain, not budgeting. **Partial revival (Q62): the read-only budget-vs-actual VIEW is now FE8** — the lifecycle engine stays unmodeled. | TOPDOWN GC-FIN-CONTROL |
| **Formal data-subject rights + retention/disposal engine** — Know/Correct/Delete requests, retention schedule, legal-hold | Handled manually; a subject request has never been received. Only stale-membership auto-purge (M3) stays in scope. | TOPDOWN GC-DATA-RIGHTS · Q17 |
| **Data-security ops** — 2FA/backups/unique-accounts/no-remote-access | Handled externally / already in the infra repo (AWS). Not app work. | Q18 |
| **Financial-controls enforcement** — COI/kinship engine, segregation-of-duties enforcer, threshold *blocking* | Replaced by a flag→human-checkoff→audit model (Q14); the app records/routes, humans enforce. | Q14 |
| **Scholarship cap engine** — 20%/50% caps, budget-line automation | Board decides case-by-case, each unique; fine as-is. | Q25 |
| **Facility/shop/incidentals fee build** | Fees live in Shopify, paid by a few folks; no app build needed. | Q25 |
| **Payment-plan Shopify flow** | Payment plans handled directly in QuickBooks; not building a Shopify flow. | Q25 |
| **M9 — Corporate / Org-Partner membership** | Not needed in a real timeframe (Q33). | Q33 |

## Dropped — confirmed built (not backlog)

**RB19** — pentest email-enumeration oracle: verified **already closed / not exploitable** (fix-chip made no code change, 2026-07-21). Dropped.

**Obsolete (2026-07-21):** SA2 wipe-polluted-blanket-BG-**DATA** — no *pre-import* polluted rows remain (everyone re-imported per-adult after the DB change). **⚠ CORRECTION (2026-08-01):** the earlier speculation that this *also moots the blanket-stamp→per-adult CODE defect* was **WRONG** (verified vs main while scoping #1260). The `review.ts:305` blanket `updateMany` never stopped — new pollution accrues on **every** household clearance. That is a **LIVE critical safety defect** and is now **SA1 / #1260** (not dropped, not moot).

**SA1 "BG automation remainder" DECOMPOSED (2026-08-01; slice statuses CORRECTED while scoping #1260, verified vs main):** **cron cohort-open** = BUILT (Trigger A, `cron/person-bg-annual`) · **consent link/email** = **NOT built** (board-manual submit only, no in-app orchestration; #961 territory) · ~~supplier affirmation~~ = **PHANTOM slice — NOT REAL** (owner-confirmed 2026-08-02: the BG supplier is **PDF-only, no API**, so there is nothing to programmatically affirm; the term propagated undefined from an early deferred list and was never a feature — dropped) · **blanket-stamp→per-adult** = **SHIPPED** (#1470, SA1/#1260; my earlier "MOOT" was WRONG) · **enforcement/grace** = **SA18** (board-gated by SA5). Plus **SA17** self-attest split. Escalation half = **SA4**.

**SA1 blanket-stamp→per-adult BG subjects — SHIPPED (#1470, 2026-08-07):** a household
clearance now stamps only the adult the reviewers named, and the board gets a worklist for the
stamps the old blanket write left behind. Rules live in `docs/rules/membership.md` § background
checks.

**Verified built during triage (2026-07-21), removed from buckets:** M10 volunteer-household pre-designation (`/membership-ops/volunteer-memberships`) · M11 intake-notes → surfaced to reviewer (`membership-ops/review`, `Household.intakeNotes`) · SA5 BG posture (29mo, enforced at renewal) · SA8 dual-relationship = Trusted Adults · RB10 dual-email = 2-account model (#286 closed) · FD5 banker = board (no role).

**Merged to main (verified via rebase 2026-07-25), removed from buckets:** **AT10** unknown-DOB fails-open in two-deep → FIXED, now fails closed (#1353/#300) · **AT13** visit-edit UI/API mismatch → FIXED, board reaches the visit-edit UI (#1350/#1259) · **M18** person-merge orphaned/non-controlled email → FIXED via 3 merge-fixes: emailSuppressed carry (#1332), login-identity unit (#1329), tombstone `.invalid` domain (#1331); #1225 closed · **SA6** delete-DoB for adults → BUILT (#1326 "delete DoB for all adults (26+)"; #1356 declared-adults-still-supervise follow-up); #1165 closed · **P17** staff-household enrollment ban server-side → BUILT (#1009 "disable Add Participant & Grant Membership for staff households").

**Merged/resolved (2026-08-01):** **RB16** boundary-isolation required-check → DONE — #1132 (CODEOWNERS gate) + #1133 (isolation job now a required status check on main) both closed. Was Q38.

From chip E (verified in code) + D2 (landed): renewal BG re-trigger + no-email-lookup (A7), reviewer-sets-volunteer (A14 core), trusted-adults dedup+revoke (A15), emergency-contact external check (A16), **RSVP subsystem** (B11), **recurring events** (B12), keyholder warn + forced-signout (C6/C8), orphaned-payment queue (D21), payment-plan keyholder-invisibility (D22), reviewer anti-collusion (F9), denied-login block (G2), system metrics (G13), duplicate-visit detection (#563), allergies-on-add-member (#800), Zoho auto-send contracts (#189), Shopify match-audit report (#1048).
