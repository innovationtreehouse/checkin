# Finance and payments

Fees, refunds, payment plans, and reconciliation.

## Policy

### Fees are fees

- Membership and program fees are fees, not charitable donations, and cannot be
  paid by means of giving from which the payer must receive no benefit.
  — *Membership Policy, Art. XI; Sponsored Program Policy, Art. VI §VI.2*

- The board sets the cost of all memberships, and may discount for financial
  need, college students, partner organisations, service-program participants,
  and volunteers with no youth in any program. — *Membership Policy, Art. XI*

- Program fees before scholarship adjustment are equal for all members.
  — *Sponsored Program Policy, Art. VI §VI.2*

- A participant who completes a registration is responsible for paying for it.
  — *Sponsored Program Policy, Art. VIII*

### Refunds and plans

- The membership fee is refunded on denial of membership; an accepted offset for
  the background check is not. Otherwise no refund once membership or program
  participation is approved, absent an extreme circumstance. A program refund is
  the program leader's decision with board approval; a Treehouse-level refund is
  the board's alone. — *Membership Policy, Art. XII*

- Dismissal from membership is without refund. — *Definitions Policy, Art. III,
  "Dismiss from Membership"*

- A membership payment plan does not extend beyond the membership year it
  covers. A program payment plan does not extend beyond the later of the
  program's end and 90 days from its start. Late payment under a plan may lead
  to dismissal. — *Membership Policy, Art. XIII*

- No more than 20% of total participant fees may be waived by scholarship
  without board approval, rising to 50% where total fees are $20 or less per
  participant; externally designated scholarship funds are excluded from the
  count. — *Sponsored Program Policy, Art. VII*

### Program money

- Funds supporting a program flow through the Treehouse; anything else needs
  specific board approval. — *Sponsored Program Policy, Art. III §III.5*

- A program budget is approved by the board before any spending is committed.
  — *Sponsored Program Policy, Art. III §III.6*

- A program budget cannot be approved where a majority of the affirmative votes
  come from people with a conflict of interest with the program leader or
  program treasurer. — *Sponsored Program Policy, Art. III §III.7*

- Someone with a conflict of interest in a matter takes no part in deciding it,
  and the same person does not authorise, execute, and monitor a transaction.
  — *Ethics Policy, Art. III §III.5; Financial Policy, Art. III*

- Payment processors must be PCI DSS compliant; storage and SaaS vendors must be
  SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliant. — *Definitions Policy, Art. III, "Suitably
  Secure Electronic Means"*

## Assumptions

Things the app takes as true because they are handled outside it.

- Refunds are issued outside the app, in the store and the books. The app sees a
  reversal after the fact; it never owes one.

- Payment-plan terms are agreed within the limits policy sets, and the books hold
  them. The app records that a plan was approved, never its schedule or its
  amounts.

- A plan finishing happens in the books too. When a family completes their
  instalments finance records it there; the app has no screen for marking a plan
  paid off, and was never meant to.

- Program budgets live outside the app — their approval, the conflict-of-interest
  rule on that vote, and the requirement that program funds flow through the
  Treehouse are all handled there.

## Procedure

### Ownership

- Finance Ops belongs to the board; sysadmins are excluded outright.  [Unsettled — which superuser]

- The store is the source of truth for what was paid. The local mirror is a copy
  that reconciliation reads; no payment fact is authored here.  [Decision]

- Nobody decides a scholarship or payment plan for their own household.  [Decision — *Policy: Ethics Policy, Art. III §III.5*]

- A financial control is a flag a person signs off, with the sign-off recorded.
  It is not a gate that decides on its own.  [Decision — *Principle: people decide about people*]

- Whether a payment goes to the real store, the test store, or a local stand-in
  is decided by which environment the app is told it is running in — never
  guessed from whether store credentials happen to be present.  [Decision — *Principle: fail closed*]

- A program's price lives on the program. Where one run of it needs a different
  price, that is set against the run — not by issuing a code people pass around.
  Early-bird and sliding rates are the store's to run, not ours to model.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- The volunteer membership rate is the exception, and it is a code. Anyone
  holding it can redeem it, entitled or not: checkout does not check. A household
  that used it without being a volunteer household is caught afterwards, when
  reconciliation compares who redeemed it against who was owed it.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

### Reconciliation

- Charged is owed minus discount, so a charge below the amount owed is expected,
  never a mismatch.  [Decision]

- A reversal seen at the store — a refund, chargeback or cancellation — must
  reach membership and enrollment state. The app raises it for the board to work;
  it does not undo anything by itself.  [Decision — *Principle: people decide about people*]

- The store owns what a discount comes to; the app owns who may use one and until
  when. An order carrying the right item is correct whatever it totals — checking
  the total against a configured price drifts the moment the two disagree.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- Only what the app sells reconciles: a membership, or a program. Donations and
  merchandise pass through untouched.  [Decision]

- There is no fee ledger. What a family owes and has paid for a program is the
  enrollment's own state and the store order behind it, never a separate record of
  charges and payments kept alongside.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- Reconciliation problems surface on the finance board, where payments live. A
  payment crosses membership and programs, so neither of those views alone is the
  place to raise one.  [Decision]

- The board can force the mirror to catch up. It only ever catches up; replaying
  history is not reachable that way.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- An activation's payment basis is paid, free, comped or scholarship; one with
  none is reported as a gap.  [Decision — *Principle: accountability*]

- Payment against a blocked application is a refund obligation, never a
  satisfied claim.  [Decision]

### Requests and communication

- Membership and program payment plans are separate queues, and store holds are
  a third. One list covering all of them was rejected.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- An applicant gets exactly one automatic message about a request — the
  acknowledgement that it arrived. Non-payment notices are a separate stream.
  That acknowledgement never suggests the matter is closed or that nothing
  further is needed, because the amount, the schedule and any discount are still
  to be agreed — finance settles those with the board and writes to the family
  itself. The app never learns those terms, so it cannot speak for them.  [Decision — *Principle: people decide about people*]

- Submitting a request for a scholarship or a payment plan does not settle the
  fee it concerns. The membership stays unactivated and the enrollment stays
  unconfirmed until finance approves the request; until then the record waits
  where it is.  [Decision]

- A balance the household can pay looks different from one waiting on finance.
  The second is not theirs to act on.  [Decision]

- A request for something starting after the next membership year is marked as
  such, never hidden or filtered away.  [Decision — deliberate limit]


- Removal for non-payment is a human decision on an admin surface.  [Decision — *Principle: people decide about people*]
