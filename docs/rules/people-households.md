Households, leads, identity and age status, emergency contacts, and trusted
adults.

## Policy

### Who is who

- An adult is 18 or older. A youth is anyone under 18, and throughout the
  policies "child" is interchangeable with it. — *Definitions Policy, Art. III,
  "Adult" / "Youth"*

- A student is anyone enrolled in school through twelfth grade, which can run to
  age 19. Student and youth are therefore not the same set, and neither is
  interchangeable with a program's participants. — *Definitions Policy,
  Art. III, "Student"*

- A member family resides at one address, contains no more than two adults, and
  all its youth are the children or dependents of those adults. — *Definitions
  Policy, Art. III, "Member Family"*

- A visitor is anyone at a location or event who is not a member. — *Definitions
  Policy, Art. III, "Visitor"*

- Being removed from a volunteer role is not dismissal from membership: one
  removes a role, the other ends all association. — *Volunteer Policy, Art. V*

### Responsibility for youth

- Parents, guardians, or authorised caregivers are responsible for their youth
  at drop-off and pickup and throughout events and locations, including travel
  for a program. — *Membership Policy, Art. IV*

- Youth under 10 are never dropped off and left. — *Event, Location and
  Keyholder Policy, Art. IX*

- A drop-off is allowed only when the youth is attending a specific program
  whose leader knows they are there, or when the parent or guardian has checked
  with a named adult over 21 who agrees to be responsible — and **both parties
  hold each other's emergency contact information**. — *Event, Location and
  Keyholder Policy, Art. IX*

- A dual relationship exists where the adult is the youth's parent, guardian, or
  sibling, or where a parent or guardian has specifically identified that person
  and had the status approved. — *Definitions Policy, Art. III, "Dual
  Relationship"*

### Member information

- Members keep their information current within the membership year, including
  changes to family members, contact details, and emergency contacts.
  — *Membership Policy, Art. III §III.1*

- Personal information is shared on a need-to-know basis and is not sold.
  — *Records Policy, Art. IV; Art. V §V.1*

- A member may ask for inaccurate information to be corrected, and may ask for
  personal information to be deleted except where it is legally required, needed
  for member safety, or a condition of the membership or program participation
  they wish to keep. — *Records Policy, Art. V §§V.3–V.4*

- Records no longer needed for operations or required by law should not be kept.
  — *Records Policy, Art. VI §VI.2*

## Assumptions

Things the app takes as true because they are handled outside it.

- A family and the adult they name exchange contact details between themselves.
  The app records the family's side of that.

- Drop-off practice is handled at the door, including who may be left and the
  rule against leaving a youth under 10.

- A trusted adult is over 21, confirmed by the board when it approves them. They
  are a named counterparty rather than a person record, so the app holds no date
  of birth to check.

- The app owns who people are, and deduplicating them is its job. The
  background-check vendor holds the sensitive detail behind a check; none of it
  is imported.

- An email address identifies one person, because that is how signing in works.
  Two people cannot share one, and a household wanting to share an address is
  asking for something the sign-in cannot express.

## Procedure

### Households and leads

- Every person belongs to a household from sign-up. There is no householdless
  person.  [Decision]

- A household has at most two leads, and removing the last one is refused. The
  lead cap is the app's proxy for the two-adult limit; membership itself is not
  capped.  [Decision — *Policy: Definitions Policy, Art. III, "Member Family"*]

- A lead always leads their own household; leading another is unsupported.  [Decision]

- A youth cannot be made a household lead. An unknown date of birth reads as
  adult here — a standing exception to *Principle: fail closed*.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- A household adds its own members through its leads. The board and sysadmin path
  into any household is a separate one and is unaffected.  [Decision — *Principle: self-scope and repair*]

- A young adult still part of their family — away at college included — stays a
  member of that household rather than leading one of their own.  [Decision — *Policy: Definitions Policy, Art. III, "Member Family"*]

- A household counts as claimed once a lead has signed in, by any route. Waiting
  for every member to sign in was rejected — the list exists to find families who
  never arrived, not to reach a state nobody can guarantee.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- An account on the organisation's own email domain is a Treehouse account, not
  a member family, and cannot add members to its own household. The board and
  sysadmin path for adding someone to any household is unaffected.  [Decision]

### Identity and age

- Every household member has a date of birth or an over-25 declaration. Neither
  present is a surfaced gap.  [Decision]

- Date of birth is not retained past 25; the declaration replaces it
  automatically as members age out. Twenty-five holds three things at once: we
  keep nothing we do not need, by then nobody's own age restricts what they may
  do here, and it is young enough that someone of 25 is very unlikely to be the
  parent of anyone in our programs.  [Decision — *Policy: Records Policy, Art. VI §VI.2*]

- Date of birth is the only field with an ageing-out rule. Broader retention is
  deliberately not automated while the organisation is young and little has
  accumulated; the general obligation is met by hand until that stops being true.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- A youth cannot edit their own profile. As with leadership, an unknown date of
  birth reads as adult.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- Self-service member add always creates a new person, never adopts an existing
  account by email. Where the address is already in use the add is refused
  without saying whether anyone holds it — only what will happen if they do.  [Decision — *Principle: no existence oracle*]

- Email identity is case-insensitive.  [Decision]

- Where someone signs in with Google, the address they sign in with is the
  address they are contacted at. There is no second one to diverge from it.  [Decision]

- A person is never lost. A merged record is kept and marked as merged rather
  than removed, and drops out of every live list, count and roster. A record of
  what happened still names them, because hiding a since-merged identity there
  would falsify the history rather than protect anyone.  [Decision — *Principle: decisions are reversible*]

- A merge moves email, sign-in identity and verification together as one unit,
  never split across the two records.  [Decision]

- A merged person's pre-merge state is recorded, so a merge of the wrong two
  people can be investigated and the person reconstructed. There is no un-merge:
  what the record does not carry is which rows moved, so putting a bad merge right
  is hand work, not a button.  [Decision — *Principle: decisions are reversible*]

### Who may see what

- A program leader reaches a participant's contact details and their emergency
  contact, never their date of birth.  [Decision — *Principle: least privilege*]

- Keyholders hold the board's email and phone as the front desk's emergency
  reference. It is a grant made on purpose, not an over-share to be narrowed.  [Decision]

### Emergency contacts

- An emergency contact is someone outside the household; one matching a member
  by phone, email or name is refused.  [Decision — *Policy: Event, Location and Keyholder Policy, Art. IX*]

- An emergency contact needs a name and a phone number. One missing either does
  not count toward the household's obligation to have one.  [Decision]

- An emergency contact's relationship to the household is optional free text,
  with no picklist of types.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- A household names at least one emergency contact at intake, and its last valid
  contact cannot be removed.  [Decision]

- A household change that invalidates a contact flags the row and keeps it.
  Nothing is blocked; the household resolves it.  [Decision]

- A missing emergency contact is the household's to fix and the board's to chase.
  It raises a list of the households to contact, a count in the board's
  navigation, and a notification the front desk sees too. Nothing is blocked —
  chasing it is a conversation, not a refusal at the door.  [Decision — *Principle: people decide about people*]

### Trusted adults

- Trusted-adult approval belongs to the household, not to an individual member.  [Decision — *Policy: Event, Location and Keyholder Policy, Art. IX*]

- The family's context note is written for the board and read by the board and
  the family, never by keyholders or program leaders. The board's note on its own
  decision is the board's alone. What reaches the front desk is the shared note
  below, and nothing else.  [Decision — *Policy: Ethics Policy, Art. IV*]

- How a trusted adult is connected to the family is prose inside the context note
  the family has to write. There is no separate relationship field.  [Decision — deliberate limit]

- Amending a trusted adult's details does not disturb the live approval, and
  rejecting the amendment is a separate action from revoking the person.  [Decision]

- Withdrawing a trusted adult retires every approval they hold, not just the
  most recent, and drops them from the pickup list at once.  [Decision]

- An approval lasts a year. The family is warned a month out and resubmits
  without re-entering what the board already holds.  [Decision]

- A withdrawn trusted adult can be hidden from the household's own view, and the
  household cannot bring it back. The record is kept, but no board surface lists
  it either — the review queue holds what is awaiting action or expiring, and the
  pickup list holds what is approved. A withdrawn one survives in the audit trail
  rather than in anyone's view.  [Decision]

- One board member settles a disclosure; it does not need the whole board.  [Decision]

- A visitor may raise one, not only a member.  [Decision]

- Approving one requires a note the front desk can act on — read by the family,
  keyholders and program leaders, and never shown on the kiosk.  [Decision — *Policy: Records Policy, Art. IV*]
