/**
 * Background-check provider abstraction.
 *
 * Averity (VERITY / Verity Secure) exposes NO public API — only a hosted
 * consent page (a deep link) and email notifications to a human. So the
 * provider's job is narrow: hand applicants the right consent link. Consent
 * and completion are recorded by a human marking them in our system (see
 * markBgConsent / the BG review in PR7). The system never sees background-check
 * results — only whether a board member has attested to them.
 *
 * Keeping this behind an interface means a future provider with a real API can
 * drop in without touching the flow.
