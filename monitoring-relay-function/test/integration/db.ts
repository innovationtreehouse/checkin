/**
 * Shared scaffolding for the relay's DB-gated integration tier.
 *
 * These suites drive runRelay against a REAL monitoring Postgres (booted by the harness),
 * with only SNS and telemetry mocked — so the actual claim→publish→mark queries and their
 * ordering/persistence are exercised end to end, not just at the query-builder level.
 *
 * We deliberately reuse @inventory/monitoring-db's `prisma` singleton (the same client
 * runRelay uses) for seeding and assertions, so there is exactly one DB session in play.
 * runRelay's drain holds a SESSION-scoped advisory lock across the whole batch; keeping all
 * traffic on the one pooled connection (every query awaited, never Promise.all'd) keeps that
 * lock valid and avoids a lingering lock between tests. Cross-session lock exclusion itself
 * is proven in packages/monitoring-db/test/integration/lock.test.ts and the relay's unit
 * skip test, so it is not re-litigated here.
