/**
 * Relay orchestration.
 *
 * Drains PENDING outbox rows and publishes each to SNS, marking it SENT only after a
 * successful publish. Delivery is idempotent and retried: a failed publish leaves the row
 * PENDING (attempts++/lastError) for the next run; the health_event preserves the incident
 * regardless. Emits its own heartbeat so a dead relay is caught by the missing-data floor.
 *
 * Concurrency (F19): the whole claim→publish drain runs under a Postgres advisory lock, so
 * two overlapping invocations cannot read the same PENDING batch and double-publish — the
 * single-flight guarantee is defended in code, not just by reserved concurrency = 1. A second
 * invocation that can't take the lock skips cleanly (without a heartbeat — the lock-holder
 * asserts liveness).
 *
 * Delivery is AT-LEAST-ONCE. The advisory lock prevents concurrent double-publish, but not a
 * crash between a successful SNS publish and `markSent`: that row stays PENDING and is
 * published again next run. SNS standard-topic Publish is not idempotent, so a rare duplicate
 * alert is possible. This is accepted (not worth an SNS FIFO topic + dedup id): the
 * `healthEventId`/correlation trailer lets a responder collapse duplicates by eye.
 *
 * Undeliverable alerts: a permanent failure (or one that exhausts RELAY_MAX_ATTEMPTS) is
 * moved to the DEAD dead-letter state instead of retrying forever — a poison row can't wedge
 * the oldest-first drain. While any DEAD rows exist the relay reports itself unhealthy via a
 * `serviceError` metric (it stays alive/heartbeating); an operator clears them with
 * `requeueDead` once the cause is fixed.
