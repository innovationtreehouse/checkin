/**
 * Watchdog orchestration.
 *
 * Freshness is PUSH-based (F7): each service writes its own run outcome into the dedicated
 * monitoring DB's `service_heartbeat` table; the watchdog READS those rows in one query
 * rather than connecting to each service's financial database. For every registered service
 * it then decides staleness (no recent success) or erroring (recent runs are failing), and
 * on any unhealthy condition emits a (dependency-light) CloudWatch metric AND records a rich
 * incident in the monitoring DB. The metric is the floor that survives a monitoring-DB
 * outage; the health_event/outbox carry the "why" and drive the alert.
 *
 * STALE takes precedence over ERRORING: with no recent success at all the pipeline is
 * effectively down (CRITICAL); ERRORING is the earlier WARNING state where runs still
 * succeed within the window but newer runs have begun to fail. A service with no heartbeat
 * row at all (registered but never reported) is stale with a null age — same as the old
 * probe's "no COMPLETED run on record".
 *
 * Emission order matters: the metric (EMF → stdout) fires FIRST and unconditionally, so a
 * monitoring-DB failure can't suppress the signal. recordIncident is best-effort on top.
