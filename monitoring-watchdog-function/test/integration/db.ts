/**
 * Shared scaffolding for the watchdog's DB-gated integration tier.
 *
 * These suites drive runWatchdog against a REAL monitoring Postgres (booted by the harness),
 * with only telemetry mocked — so the real readServiceHeartbeats → evaluate → recordIncident
 * path runs end to end, including the transactional health_event+outbox write and the
 * renotify-window alert dedup that the mocked orchestration test can only simulate.
 *
 * We reuse @inventory/monitoring-db's `prisma` singleton (the client runWatchdog uses) for
 * seeding and assertions, so there is one DB session in play. runWatchdog holds a
 * SESSION-scoped advisory lock across the run; keeping all traffic on the one pooled
 * connection (every query awaited) keeps that lock valid between tests. Cross-session lock
 * exclusion is proven in packages/monitoring-db/test/integration/lock.test.ts and the
 * watchdog's unit skip test, so it is not re-litigated here.
