/**
 * MONEY-PATH SAFETY GATE for the volunteer-designation normalization change.
 *
 * applyVolunteerStatus (src/lib/membership/review.ts) sets Membership.isVolunteer
 * when a household lead's email matches a VolunteerDesignation — and isVolunteer
 * DRIVES DUES. The email-normalization rule used for that match changed from the
 * OLD review rule (strip dots on EVERY domain, keep +tag) to canonicalizeEmail
 * (Gmail-only dot-drop, strip +tag). Those two produce different match sets.
 *
 * This script recomputes the designation-match result for every household under
 * BOTH rules against the live DB and prints every household whose volunteer match
 * RESULT CHANGES (gained or lost). Empty diff = safe to flip. Non-empty = human
 * review required before merge.
 *
 * NOTE: only the designation-match path is modeled. The markedByReviewer path
 * (isVolunteer already true) is unaffected by normalization and out of scope.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/dues-diff-volunteer-match.ts
 *
 * Bootstraps Prisma exactly like prisma/seed.ts (PrismaPg adapter, DATABASE_URL).
