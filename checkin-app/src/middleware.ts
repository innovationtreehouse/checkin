/**
 * Site-wide org-login gate for the cloud dev instance (see DEV_INSTANCE_DESIGN.md §4)
 * — and the ops-stg ACCESS GATE (see docs on the staging access gate).
 *
 * When CHECKIN_ENV=dev, every page route requires a session whose Google hosted-domain (`hd`)
 * claim is the org domain and whose email is verified. Anonymous visitors and bots are bounced
 * to Google login and can read nothing else — delivering both "reachable by org members" and
 * "not world-readable".
 *
 * In `prod` and `local` the gate is inert (public surfaces stay public; local work needs no Google).
 *
 * On ops-stg (isStaging()) the predicate is the same verified-org-member check, OR'd with
 * canAccessStaging (the sysadmin-settable escape hatch). An AUTHENTICATED caller who fails it
 * is bounced to the bare /access-denied page, not /signin: ops-stg runs a scrubbed copy of
 * PRODUCTION data behind PROD's Google OAuth client, deliberately unrestricted to the org
 * workspace, so ANY Google account can complete sign-in and re-prompting login would only
 * loop a stranger through Google to the same wall. An ANONYMOUS caller still goes to /signin,
 * like the dev gate — otherwise an org member who hasn't logged in yet dead-ends on a page
 * that deliberately carries no sign-in affordance. This is only ONE of three surfaces the gate covers —
 * see isStagingAccessAllowed's callers in lib/auth.ts (authenticateRequest, the API chokepoint)
 * and security/access-resolvers.ts (resolveAccess, the `authorize: 'public'` path this
 * middleware's matcher can never reach because /api is exempt below).
