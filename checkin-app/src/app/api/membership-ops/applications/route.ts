/**
 * GET /api/membership-ops/applications — in-flight membership applications for the board.
 * Every process not yet ACTIVE, with its household + external-phase flags.
 *
 * Field visibility is governed by the security registry (isSysadmin/board get the
 * full applicant PII; anyone else admitted would be stripped to public). The bag
 * is keyed by the model name so the stripper can classify it; the 'processes'
 * envelope preserves the response shape consumers expect.
 *
 * ?archived=1 flips to the board's recovery view: only ARCHIVED rows, so a
 * wrongly-archived application can be found and restored (unarchive route).
