/**
 * Merge-repoint exhaustiveness guard — the Person-FK analogue of
 * livePersonDriftGuard.test.ts, and the same two-assertion shape (nothing
 * unlisted, nothing stale).
 *
 * A participant merge has to decide something about EVERY foreign key pointing
 * at `Person`. The list of those decisions lived only in `merge/route.ts`'s
 * control flow, hand-maintained, and it drifted: #1456 slice 2b-0 found SIX
 * relations the merge had never touched at all — including `RawBadgeLog`
 * (RESTRICT, so the tombstone could never be deleted) and `PersonRole`
 * (CASCADE, so a later delete would destroy a security grant with no audit
 * row). None of that produced a compiler error or a failing test; the relations
 * were simply absent, and absence is invisible.
 *
 * So the key set is DERIVED from the schema at test time and matched against
 * the annotated DISPOSITIONS map below. Add a Person FK to schema.prisma and
 * this test fails until someone writes down what the merge does with it.
 *
 * The four dispositions:
 *   - repointed        the row moves to the survivor
 *   - deduped          moved unless the survivor already has the equivalent
 *                      row, in which case the duplicate is deleted
 *   - pre-refused      a collision here refuses the whole merge before the
 *                      transaction opens (a human has to settle it first)
 *   - deliberately-left the row stays where it is, for a stated reason
 *
 * ponytail: the map is declarative — it does not grep route.ts to prove the
 * repoint still exists. Deleting a repoint is caught by the per-relation
 * integration cases in route.integration.test.ts (each one fails if its
 * `updateMany` goes away); a text grep here would just match some other line
 * using the same field name. This guard closes the OTHER half — a relation
 * nobody considered at all.

 *
 * Matches the to-one side only (`foo Person @relation(fields: [fooId], ...)`),
