/**
 * Program-context household intake. Lets an auth-first program registrant fill
 * the household details (address, emergency contact, primary parent, children)
 * that the enroll step needs, when they arrive with a fresh single-person
 * household. See docs/designs/auth-first-registration.md (PR C).
 *
 * Deliberately PROCESS-FREE: it calls the membership intake service's
 * getIntakeState / saveIntake WITHOUT opening or advancing an
 * OrgMembershipProcess (that's startIntake / submitIntake — membership only).
 * Enrolling in one workshop is not a membership application. saveIntake itself
 * scopes every write to the caller's own household and requires household
 * leadership, so no extra authorization is needed here beyond a session.
