 *   STALE_BG  — ACTIVE household whose background check aged past bgRecheckMonths
 *               (predicate owned by householdBgIsFresh; skipped when the board
 *               hasn't set the policy — bgRecheckMonths = 0 or no membership-year
 *               boundary).
 *   REVOKED / DENIED — OrgMembership status.
 *   STUCK_BG_CLEARANCE — a process parked at PENDING_BG_CLEARANCE (paid, never cleared).
 * A household with multiple problems gets all its reason tags.
 *
 * Also returns two PERSON-scoped lists (program people may not sit in a member
 * household, so they can't key on householdId):
 *   peopleNeedingBgCheck — check-obligated people ≥18 (as of the boundary) with no
 *                          fresh check. Skipped when the policy is unset.
 *   peopleMissingDob     — check-obligated people whose age is unknown (no DOB,
 *                          not declared 25+): data hygiene, NOT bg-needed.
 * Check-obligated = BG_OBLIGATED_WHERE: program-attached, or a signing adult (lead)
 * of an ACTIVE member household.
 *
 * And two lists of background-check dates that trace to no named person (#1260):
 *   blanketStamped          — households cleared before per-adult subjects existed,
 *                             where every lead was stamped. One-time cleanup; narrow
 *                             it with ?bgClearedSince=YYYY-MM-DD.
 *   mergeInheritedBgChecks  — survivors of a person merge who took the merged-away
