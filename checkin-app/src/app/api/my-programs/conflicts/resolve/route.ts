/**
 * Resolve an attendance conflict by deleting one of the duplicate Visit rows.
 * Real write, audited like every other Visit change (action DELETE, tableName
 * 'Visit', actorId, oldData snapshot) — see attendance/route.ts.
 *
 * Authorization is re-checked server-side (never trust the client): the caller
 * must lead the program that owns the event for the visit being deleted, or be a
 * global admin (isSysadmin/isBoardMember/isKeyholder) — mirroring the attendance route.
 * And the visit must actually be part of an overlap, so we can't be tricked into
 * deleting a participant's legitimate sole visit.
 *
 * ponytail: a plain lead can only delete a visit ANCHORED to their own event
 * (associatedEventId). In the kiosk-race case that's exactly the synthetic row to
 * drop (keep the real badge-in); the unassociated kiosk row is not directly
 * deletable here. Widen with an overlap-based scope check if leads need to delete
 * the kiosk side too.
