// Denies a pending membership scholarship / payment-plan request — the sibling
// of POST /api/finance-ops/membership-payment-plans (approve) that membership
// previously lacked, so a declined request had no board action and sat
// PENDING_PAYMENT on the queue indefinitely. This gives the board a dedicated
// deny control (docs/PROGRAM_CAPACITY_AND_SCHOLARSHIPS.md §5 item 4).
//
// Silent by design, like every other board decision (approve on both sides,
// program deny): sends NO automatic applicant email — the Scholarship Review
// Team communicates the outcome manually. Denial is purely clearing
// isPaymentPlanRequested back to false: the process stays PENDING_PAYMENT and
// the household returns to normal "pay your dues to activate". Membership holds
// no Shopify seat and has no grace-expiry cron (grace is program-only), so there
// is no seat to release and no paymentPlanDeniedAt to stamp — OrgMembershipProcess
// has no such column and needs none; the cleared flag is the whole of denial state.
