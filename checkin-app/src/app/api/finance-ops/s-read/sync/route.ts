/**
 * POST /api/finance-ops/s-read/sync — the board forces an s-read incremental sync
 * now, instead of waiting for the daily 09:00 UTC tick.
 *
 * The reconciler (api/cron/reconcile-shopify) reads a mirror that s-read refreshes
 * once a day, so a payment problem fixed in Shopify this morning still shows as OPEN
 * on the payments queue until tomorrow. This button closes that gap: it re-reads
 * Shopify into the mirror, after which the next reconcile run sees current truth.
 *
 * Invokes the `s-read-<env>-trigger` Lambda — the same entry point the EventBridge
 * schedule uses, which RunTasks the sync family with a SYNC_MODE override
 * (s-read-function/DEPLOY.md). This is deliberately NOT a direct ecs:RunTask from
 * here: the trigger Lambda already owns the cluster/task-def/network wiring, so
 * reusing it keeps this app's IAM grant to a single lambda:InvokeFunction on a
 * single function ARN, and keeps checkin out of the s-read VPC entirely.
 *
 * SECURITY — the mode is a hardcoded literal and the request body is never read.
 * The trigger Lambda also accepts {"mode":"backfill"}, which submits a Shopify Bulk
 * Operation; letting a caller name the mode would turn one board click into an
 * API-budget burn. The IAM grant must likewise cover ONLY this function — never
 * s-replay-function, whose replay/reset-watermark ops re-project financial history
 * and are IAM-gated with mandatory actor/reason audit by design.
 *
 * Concurrency is s-read's problem and s-read already solves it: reserved
 * concurrency = 1 plus the per-store `withSyncRun` lock means a second run while one
 * is in flight is skipped, not corrupted.
 *
 * No AuditLog row: it takes a non-null tableName + affectedEntityId and this touches
 * no checkin entity. The actor is logged here, and s-read stamps its own `sync_run`.
 *
 * GET on the same path reports the latest run's status — see below.

/**
 * GET /api/finance-ops/s-read/sync — the latest s-read run, so the payments page can
 * say how fresh "Live payment" is and tell whether a sync it just started has landed.
 *
 * Gated on the MIRROR, not on the trigger the POST gates on: the two are separate
 * wiring (the mirror connection vs S_READ_TRIGGER_FUNCTION), and an env can
 * legitimately have one without the other. Unwired → 503, matching the POST, so the
 * page can just hide the status line rather than special-case a success body that
 * means "no answer".
 *
 * Same board/sysadmin gate as the POST. `sync_run` is operational metadata (status,
 * kind, timings, row counts) about the store as a whole — no per-person or
 * per-order data — but it rides the same queue-level boundary as the rest of
 * finance-ops rather than being widened for no caller.
 *
 * The status is read verbatim from the mirror; the caller decides what to do with a
 * value it does not recognise (s-read owns that enum and may extend it).
