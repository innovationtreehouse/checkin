/**
 * GET /api/finance-ops/s-read/match-audit — the bidirectional Shopify ↔ activation
 * completeness report (lib/finance/matchAudit.ts): every mirror order carrying a
 * membership/program VARIANT accounted for, every ACTIVE membership/enrollment
 * traced to an order, a board certification, or flagged as having no payment basis.
 *
 * Read-only: reports, raises no PaymentExceptions, changes nothing. On-demand only
 * (a board click on the payments page) — it sweeps the whole mirror-relevant
 * surface, so it must never run on a poll or cron (scale-to-zero Aurora; the same
 * cost rule as the diagnose route).
 *
 * Same board/sysadmin gate + mirror-503 shape as the sibling s-read routes, so the
 * page can treat "not wired here" uniformly.
