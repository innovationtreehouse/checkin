/**
 * THE security policy. One entry per API endpoint and one per outbound surface.
 *
 * Every change here is a change to what data leaves the server, to which
 * role, through which channel. CODEOWNERS-gated, and boundary changes must
 * ship in their OWN PR (enforced by security-boundary-isolation.yml) so a
 * widening/narrowing is always an isolated, reviewable unit.
 *
 * This layer exists to make the policy easy to AUDIT — it is not a substitute
 * for careful route management. Handlers still owe tight selects and
 * deliberate response shapes; the stripper is the declared-policy backstop,
 * not the first line.
 *
 * orderedView is walked top-to-bottom; the first role the caller satisfies
 * decides the view. Order matters — treat reorders as policy changes.

// Subject ownership is enforced in the route body, which 404s any id the caller
// may not act for; the two per-row tokens are the field backstop for the two
// legitimate subjects:
//   their_own      — Visit.personId === caller (a member editing their own row)
//   led_households — Visit.personId is in a household the caller LEADS (AT3,
//                    #1254: the lead is the responsible adult for members who
//                    cannot self-serve). Lead-only, not household-wide: a
//                    non-lead sibling holds neither token and sees nothing.

// the sibling GET/PATCH/DELETE on /api/facility/visits carry and the same set
// facility-ops/visits gates the page on, which must stay equal (their drifting
// apart was AT13/#1259). Widening to isOperations was answered NO: #1633 puts
// operations' reach into attendance at aggregate only (the trends, printing ID

// Board/sysadmin review of recent attendance-correction activity (AT12,
// #1258). The handler does not query Visit directly — it reads AuditLog rows
// where tableName === 'Visit' and SYNTHESIZES a Visit view per row from the
// audit blob (arrivedAt/departedAt/arrivedVia/departedVia extracted from
// newData). stripValue (stripper.ts) copies any field present on an object
// without checking provenance, so a synthesized row strips exactly like a
// real one — that is what makes this legal, not an exception to it.
//
// 'everyones:personal' is required: Visit.arrivedAt/departedAt are
// personal-tier and this is a review-scope surface, not a self-scope one, so
// no <scope>:<tier> row token applies. 'everyones:internal' is required for
// AuditLog itself — every field on it (id, timestamp, actorId, action, …) is
// internal-tier. 'pii' and 'member' are deliberately NOT granted: no field on
// AuditLog, Person, or Visit needs either for this view.
//
// AuditLog.newData is REBUILT by the handler to { type, significance } before
// it reaches this layer; raw oldData/newData (arbitrary blob shape) must never
// leave the route. Neither obligation is enforceable HERE: 'everyones:internal'
// permits both fields wholesale and a tier does not reach inside a JSON blob,
// so a handler that passed oldData straight through would ship a whole-row
// snapshot with every suite green. The route PR carries the assertion instead
// (correctionsAPI.integration.test.ts). No pagination — nothing else here would
// give total/page/pageSize a legal home under any envelope value (handler.ts
// strips before the envelope wraps), so the handler caps rows and over-fetches
// by one to signal "more" instead.
//
// This entry also settles the open question #1497 left to the route PR: how a
// before/after pair crosses the boundary. A separate bag key is not expressible
// — stripBag drops any top-level key that is not a model name, so there can be
// exactly one Visit key — and a before row and its after row share a Visit.id,
// so no field distinguishes them. Array position is the only discriminator, and
// it survives because stripValue maps arrays element-wise and preserves order.
//
// Served by src/app/api/facility/corrections/route.ts. Its flagged-only default
// view is complete only once every Visit audit write persists
// newData.significance (#1523, PR #1558) — an unscored write never surfaces.
