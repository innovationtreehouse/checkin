/**
 * SCOPE_BINDINGS — the declarative per-row scope table.
 *
 * Ported 1:1 from the imperative `switch (modelName)` that lived in
 * access-resolvers.ts (`scopesHeld`). Each entry says: "the caller holds
 * <scope> on a <Model> row when <Match> holds." The engine (scopes.ts) seeds
 * `everyones` and applies these; the equivalence test
 * (scopeBindingsEquivalence.test.ts) proves set-equality with the old switch
 * across every persona × model × row, which is the contract that this port is
 * behavior-neutral.
 *
 * Field names verified against the LIVE generated map
 * (./generated/classifications.ts), not the §7.4 doc table. Discrepancies found
 * vs that table (see docs/security/auth-consistency-analysis.md §7.4/§7.5):
 *   - Visit:  field is `departedAt` (doc wrote `departed`).            [doc fixed]
 *   - ToolStatus: field is `personId` (renamed userId→participantId #564, then participantId→personId).
 *   - RawBadgeLog: model is `RawBadgeLog` (doc table wrote `RawBadgeEvent`).
 *   - Fee / RSVP: the live switch grouped ProgramParticipant, ProgramVolunteer,
 *     Fee and RSVP under one `case` body that read BOTH `row.programId` and
 *     `row.participantId`. `Fee` has no `participantId` column and `RSVP` has no
 *     `programId` column, so on a REAL row those reads were always `undefined`
 *     and granted nothing. #574 (Step 3 Blocker 1) dropped both dead reads:
 *     `Fee` is unbound (wholly @sensitivity:public, so it needs no binding) and
 *     `RSVP` was narrowed to `their_own`. THIS chip then RE-ADDS the RSVP
 *     program-lead grant correctly via eventId → Event.programId
 *     (ctx.eventIdsInScopePrograms) — a deliberate behavior change, diverging
 *     from the dead switch read. See the RSVP binding below + §7.5/§9 Step 3.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This file is CODEOWNERS-gated.
