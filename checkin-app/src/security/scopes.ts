/**
 * Declarative scope-resolution engine.
 *
 * The per-row scope resolver used to be an imperative `switch (modelName)` in
 * access-resolvers.ts. This file is the data-driven replacement: a small
 * `Match` vocabulary, the `evalMatch` interpreter, and `makeScopesHeld` which
 * turns a binding table into a resolver with the IDENTICAL signature
 * `(modelName, row, ctx) => Set<Scope>`.
 *
 * Why this exists: making resolution *data* (scopeBindings.ts) instead of code
 * is the minimum needed for the CI security validators below — `validateBindings`
 * (field-typo + forgotten-model catchers) and `validateRouteGrants` (the
 * route-grant ↔ binding-scope seam check). None of them can run against an
 * opaque switch. See docs/security/auth-consistency-analysis.md §7.
 *
 * The bindings + table live in scopeBindings.ts; this file is the generic
 * engine. Kept deliberately local to checkin-app/src/security — no package
 * extraction (that is §7.7, out of scope).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This file is CODEOWNERS-gated.
