/**
 * Strip-assertion for GET /api/shop/certifications. Cert status is PUBLIC BY
 * DESIGN (posted in the shop), but the participant's email is not. A bag row is
 * a ToolStatus with nested tool (Tool) + person (Person):
 *
 *   - board/sysadmin (everyones:pii) → level + tool + person name + email.
 *   - member/certifier (member+public) → level + tool + person name;
 *                                        email (pii) STRIPPED.
 *
 * `level` is @sensitivity:member, so it is visible to any authenticated member
 * but would strip for a public/unauthenticated view. Tokens are pulled from the
 * live registry, so a policy edit that regresses email exposure fails here.
 *
 * Denied-household rejection (401) is covered end-to-end by the table-driven
 * registryAuthz.integration.test — this route's authorize:'authenticated' means
 * a denied session (resolved to unauthenticated at authenticateRequest) is
 * rejected at admission before this stripper ever runs.
