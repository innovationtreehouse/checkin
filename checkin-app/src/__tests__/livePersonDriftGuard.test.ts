/**
 * LIVE_PERSON drift guard (lib/person/filters.ts) — the Person analogue of
 * lifecycleStatusLiteralAllowlist.test.ts / EDGE_INCLUDE_ALLOWLIST. Mechanics
 * (walk/skip dirs, comment-and-string-safe brace capture) are lifted straight
 * from that test.
 *
 * A merged-away Person is a TOMBSTONE, not a deleted row: `mergedIntoId` gets
 * set and the row survives forever (audit trail, moved/left join rows). Any
 * code that reads Person without routing through LIVE_PERSON (lib/person/filters.ts)
 * can silently start showing/counting a tombstone the day a merge happens to
 * touch its data — there is no compiler error, just a ghost in a list. This test
 * greps every Person-query SITE in src/app + src/lib and asserts each one either
 * (a) references LIVE_PERSON / mergedIntoId in its own query context, or
 * (b) is named in the ALLOWLIST below with a reviewed justification.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A "SITE" (three independent patterns, matching how this codebase
 * actually reads Person — see lib/person/filters.ts's consumers):
 *
 *   1. A direct list/count/mass-write call on the Person delegate:
 *        prisma.person.findMany(...) / .findFirst(...) / .count(...) /
 *        .aggregate(...) / .groupBy(...) / .updateMany(...) / .deleteMany(...)
 *                                                  (via prisma, tx, or db)
 *      excluding `findUnique` / `findUniqueOrThrow` and the single-row writes
 *      `update` / `delete` / `upsert` — see the boundary note below.
 *
 *   2. A nested pull of Person data through another model's query, under ANY of
 *      the Person-typed relation names in prisma/schema.prisma — `person`, but
 *      equally `householdMembers`, `subjectPerson`, `reviewer`, `leadMentor`, `user`, …:
 *        `<rel>: true`                          (include shorthand), or
 *        `<rel>: { ... select: ... }`           (nested select), or
 *        `<rel>: { ... include: ... }`          (nested include)
 *      That name list is DERIVED from the schema at test time
 *      (PERSON_RELATION_NAMES below), never hand-written: a Person relation under
 *      an unobvious name is exactly the blind spot this pattern exists to close,
 *      and a hand-kept list reopens it the day someone adds one.
 *      A `<rel>: { <field>: <value> }` object that carries neither `select:`
 *      nor `include:` — e.g. `person: { isKeyholder: true }`, `person: { householdId }`
 *      — is a WHERE-relation FILTER, not a data pull: it narrows the parent rows,
 *      it doesn't expose a Person's identity. That shape is intentionally out of
 *      scope (see the boundary note below).
 *
 *   3. A list/count call on a JOIN delegate that has a `person` relation:
 *        prisma.programParticipant|programVolunteer|rSVP|toolStatus
 *          .findMany(...) / .findFirst(...) / .count(...) / .aggregate(...) / .groupBy(...)
 *      excluding `findUnique` / `findUniqueOrThrow`, same as class 1.
 *      WHY THIS EXISTS: pattern 2's "a where-relation filter is not a data pull"
 *      reasoning holds for IDENTITY leaks but not for COUNTS. A headcount over a
 *      join table carries no `person:` key at all —
 *        prisma.programParticipant.count({ where: { programId } })
 *      matches neither pattern above, yet a tombstone's left-behind enrollment row
 *      (merge/route.ts leaves colliding rows on the tombstone) inflates that number
 *      and can trip a capacity gate, without any Person data ever being read. So a
 *      join-table list/count is a site in its own right: it must filter through the
 *      `person` relation (`where: { person: LIVE_PERSON }`) or be allowlisted.
 *
 * BOUNDARY — why the unique-key shapes (`findUnique`/`findUniqueOrThrow`, and the
 * single-row writes `update`/`delete`/`upsert`) are excluded entirely (from
 * BOTH patterns: a `visit.findUnique({ include: { person: true } })` is just as
 * excluded as a bare `prisma.person.findUnique(...)`):
 *   thpr's model is LISTS AND COUNTS. A `findUnique` takes a unique key (id,
 *   email, a compound unique) and returns AT MOST ONE row picked by that key —
 *   it can never leak an extra tombstone into a roster or inflate a count, so
 *   filtering it is a no-op at best. `update`/`delete`/`upsert` take that same
 *   unique key on the write side: they touch the one row the caller already
 *   resolved, so they carry the same reasoning (only `updateMany`/`deleteMany`,
 *   whose where is an unrestricted filter, can sweep tombstones in unnoticed).
 *   This is also exactly the shape merge/analyze/
 *   scan (app/api/membership-ops/participants/merge{,/analyze}/route.ts,
 *   app/api/scan/route.ts) use to load the specific record they operate ON —
 *   which is why none of those three routes needs an ALLOWLIST entry: they
 *   never appear as a scanner hit in the first place. `findFirst` is NOT
 *   excluded by function name — even when it happens to carry an `id:` equality
 *   clause (functionally the same one-row shape) it still needs a human
 *   decision, which is what the ALLOWLIST's "id-scoped findFirst" entries below
 *   record.
 *
 * THE SWEEP-VS-DISPLAY RULE (thpr, verbatim) — the test for every ALLOWLIST entry:
 *
 *     "reconcilers and cleanup sweeps must still see tombstone rows; only
 *      human-facing lists and counts filter them."
 *
 * THE WRITE RULE (mass writes — `updateMany`/`deleteMany`) — the read rule does
 * NOT transfer, so allowlisting a write needs its own judgement. A read that sees
 * a tombstone is a ghost in a list; a write that hits one silently corrupts a row
 * nobody will ever look at again. The default therefore flips: a mass write
 * filters unless it is one of two things.
 *   - TOMBSTONE MACHINERY: the merge CAS itself, which targets the tombstone on
 *     purpose (it names `mergedIntoId`, so it passes this guard for free).
 *   - STRUCTURAL: a write that must touch every row pointing at something,
 *     liveness irrelevant — e.g. reparenting a household's members before
 *     deleting the household, where skipping the tombstones leaves the RESTRICT
 *     FK unsatisfiable and the whole operation fails.
 * Everything that mutates the LIVE population — stamping a background check,
 * flagging an address, flipping a flag someone reads back — filters.
 *
 * Two assertions: no unlisted unfiltered site, and no stale allowlist entry
 * (a listed file that no longer has an unfiltered site must be removed —
 * keeps the list honest, same as the lifecycle guard).
