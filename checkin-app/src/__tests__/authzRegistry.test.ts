/**
 * Drift guard for negative-authz coverage — the authz analogue of
 * pageRegistry.test.ts. Every API route that declares a `roles:` list (the
 * withAuth role gate) is a privilege boundary; a weakened or dropped `roles:`
 * array would ship silently unless a test asserts an anon caller gets 401 and a
 * plain authenticated user gets 403.
 *
 * This walks src/app/api for every route.ts containing a `roles:` gate and
 * asserts each is listed in AUTHZ_TESTED (has a negative-authz integration
 * test) or AUTHZ_EXCLUDED (deliberately untested, with a stated reason). A new
 * role-gated route added without a deny-path test fails this test.
 *
 * Scope is the `roles:` withAuth gate ONLY — the deterministic, team-trusted
 * signal that already governs `roles` in src/lib/auth.ts. Hand-rolled
 * getServerSession routes (programs/*, shop/*, events/*, …) mix role checks
 * with ownership and are out of scope here; their boundaries live in the
 * ownership-boundary suite.
 *
 * The negative-authz tests themselves are integration tests (real Postgres,
 * INTEGRATION_DB=1) so they are NOT in the default jest run — but THIS guard is
 * a plain unit test that does run by default, so the drift is caught in CI even
 * though the integration suite is not yet gated.
