/**
 * LIVE_VISIT drift guard (lib/visit/filters.ts) — the Visit analogue of
 * livePersonDriftGuard.test.ts; scanner mechanics lifted from there.
 *
 * A deleted Visit is a TOMBSTONE, not a removed row: `deletedAt` gets set and
 * the row survives (reviewable, reversible). Any code that lists, counts, or
 * aggregates visits without routing through LIVE_VISIT silently resurrects
 * deleted visits — into the live-attendance roster, derived hours, the
 * one-open-visit guards — the day someone deletes one. This test greps every
 * Visit-query site in src/app + src/lib and asserts each one references
 * LIVE_VISIT / deletedAt in its own query context, or is named in the
 * ALLOWLIST with a reviewed justification.
 *
 * Unlike merge tombstones (which hold real resources a sweep must release),
 * a deleted visit holds nothing — so sweeps and reconcilers filter too, and
 * this ALLOWLIST is expected to stay near-empty. `findUnique`/`findUniqueOrThrow`
 * are excluded for the same boundary reason as the Person guard: a one-row
 * fetch by unique key can't leak a tombstone into a list or a count — but the
 * caller owns rejecting a tombstoned row where it matters (the route
 * pre-checks do this explicitly).
