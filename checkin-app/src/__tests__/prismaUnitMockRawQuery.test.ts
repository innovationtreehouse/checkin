 * Guards the one exception in jest.setup.js's default `@/lib/prisma` mock.
 *
 * AGENTS.md, unit tier: "These must never hit a real DB — the prisma mock
 * rejects real calls." `mintPersonId` (lib/person/mintId.ts) is the only raw
 * query a unit-tier route can legitimately reach — it runs inside the same
 * transaction as every person.create — so the mock answers that ONE statement
 * and nothing else. Widening the match to any raw query would quietly retire
 * the invariant; this is the test that stops it.
 *
 * Deliberately no `jest.mock('@/lib/prisma')` here: this suite needs the
 * default mock itself, which is the thing under test.
