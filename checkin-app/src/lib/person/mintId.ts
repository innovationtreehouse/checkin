/**
 * Issue the next Person id from the `IdCounter` row named 'person' — the person
 * id is printed on a badge, and Aurora's sequence prefetch burns ~32 of them
 * per auto-pause.
 *
 * Never rewrite this as `MAX(id) + 1`: that REUSES ids, and the adapter's
 * `deleteUser` hard-deletes a Person, so a new sign-up would inherit a deleted
 * person's number and every badge printed for the first would scan as the
 * second. `mintId.integration` case 1 is the test that stops that.
 *
 * The three clauses of the one statement: `ON CONFLICT` self-seeds (a `db push`
 * DB and the dev-reset TRUNCATE have no seed row); `GREATEST` absorbs whatever
 * the sequence has already written (fixtures, unconverted sites) without ever
 * winding the counter back; `setval` pushes the sequence up to the minted value
 * so the reverse collision can't happen either. `setval` is non-transactional
 * on purpose — a rollback leaves the gap in the sequence, not in the counter.
 *
 * `TxClient`, not `DbClient`, so the mint is always paired with its `create`:
 * minting on the root client autocommits the increment on its own, and a failed
 * create then leaves the gap this exists to prevent. Where a call site has no
 * transaction, wrap the pair in `withTx(prisma, …)`.
