/**
 * Normalize a DoB write so we never store a date of birth for someone over the
 * program-age ceiling (issue #1165 — "delete DoB for all adults").
 *
 * No age-gated program can target anyone over MAX_PROGRAM_AGE (25), so an exact
 * DoB for a 26+ person is dead weight on the most-sensitive field we hold. Strip
 * it and set isDeclaredAdult instead, so age gates, the people picker and the
 * household UI still classify them as an adult (all already honor the flag).
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - empty / null DoB       -> clear the date, leave isDeclaredAdult to the caller
 *                               (the "over 25" checkbox owns the flag in that case)
 *   - DoB implies age > 25   -> clear the date, set isDeclaredAdult = true
 *   - DoB implies age <= 25   -> keep the date, set isDeclaredAdult = false
 *                               (a real sub-26 DoB is authoritative, supersedes the flag)
 *
 * Route EVERY interactive path that persists Person.dateOfBirth through this. The
 * nightly cron + the #1165 backfill migration are the safety net for rows that
 * slip past (e.g. bulk import); this is the write-time guard so it can't creep back.
 *
 * A DoB is a calendar date, so a date string is parsed through `parseDateOnly` —
 * this is the choke-point that owns the UTC-midnight storage convention for
 * interactive writes. Callers pass a bare "yyyy-MM-dd", never a timed string.
 * See docs/designs/1149_DATE_TIME_TZ_DESIGN.md.
