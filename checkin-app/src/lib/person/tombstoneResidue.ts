// #1456 §2a census. A merged-away Person is a tombstone: the merge repoints its
// live rows to the survivor and parks only what a unique-constraint collision
// left behind. 2b-3 will delete the tombstone row, but a delete is only safe once
// its residue is resolved. This module classifies that residue by whether a
// self-serve cleanup pathway exists — the "no pathway" report the census produces.
// Shared by the census route (relation list for the _count select) and its page
// (deriving the report client-side from the returned counts). Deleted with
// LIVE_PERSON in the final teardown.

export type Disposition = 'route' | 'cascade' | 'none';

// Every Person back-relation that can hold a row after a merge, with how a human
// resolves it before the tombstone can be deleted:
//   route   — a verified self-serve DELETE exists (hint names it).
//   cascade — the FK is onDelete: Cascade, so the row is silently removed WITH
//             the tombstone. Flagged because that is data loss, not resolution.
//   none    — no self-serve route; must be resolved in the DB (or a route built).
// `route` entries are the only ones whose verb was confirmed present; when in
// doubt an entry is `none` — under-claiming a pathway is safe, inventing one is not.
