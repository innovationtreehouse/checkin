/**
 * Manual "record an external background check → submit for review" — the Phase 3
 * board-driven path. Mirrors the household BG flow: an external check exists and
 * the board asserts it; the system never sees the check itself.
 *
 * Opens a PERSON_BG obligation for `personId` if one isn't already open (reuses
 * openPersonBg's dedup + Person-row lock, so it can't double-open), then marks it
 * review-ready by setting bgConsentAt via markBgConsent — consent is IMPLICIT in a
 * self-initiated external check (there is NO in-app consent link/email). Once
 * bgConsentAt is set the obligation surfaces in the reviewer queue; two
 * distinct-household reviewers then attest to clear it.
 *
 * Idempotent: a second submit re-uses the open process, markBgConsent no-ops, and
 * reviewers are pinged only on the FIRST submit (the transition into the queue).
