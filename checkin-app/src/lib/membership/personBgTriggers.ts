 * BG_OBLIGATED_WHERE (program-attached ∪ leads of ACTIVE member households — Trigger
 * A is a daily cron over all Persons, so that membership bound is what keeps it off
 * the leads of imports, abandoned intakes and denials). Deliberately NOT
 * triggered by role-assignment: age is judged as-of a boundary, so someone who
 * turns 18 mid-year is caught at the next annual run, not when they take a role.

/**
 * Open one PERSON_BG obligation for `personId`, evaluated as of `asOf` (the annual
 * boundary for the cron, activation time for a new join; `threshold` is
 * bgFreshThreshold(asOf, bgRecheckMonths)). Idempotent + concurrency-safe: a FOR
 * UPDATE lock on the Person row serializes the check-then-insert (mirrors
 * createRenewalProcess in renewal.ts), so the daily cron and a near-cutoff
 * activation can't both open one.
 *
 * Dedup guards: (b) opens nothing unless personBgVerdict === "NEEDED" — which
 * already encodes "≥18 as of asOf AND not fresh" (FRESH/MINOR/DOB_MISSING all
 * skip); (a) opens nothing if a PERSON_BG is already in flight or blocked for this
 * person (BLOCKED is a manual-followup item, not something to auto-reopen nightly).
 * Returns the created process, or null when skipped.
