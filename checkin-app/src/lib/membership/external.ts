 *
 * The contract is recorded automatically (Zoho webhook) or manually by the
 * board. BG consent is human-marked (no Averity API): the applicant self-attests
 * after submitting on Averity (selfAttestBgConsent, #875), with the board's
 * mark-bg-consent action as the backstop. The system never sees contract content
 * or check results.
 *
 * A contract signature with no session behind it (the Zoho webhook) is attributed
 * to the `webhook:zoho-contract` system actor in the audit log.
