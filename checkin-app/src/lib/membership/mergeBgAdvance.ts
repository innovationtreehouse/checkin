 * is still parked waiting on a check. This runs when the merge is what flipped the
 * household to covered, and advances what it now covers.
 *
 * Scope: household INITIAL/RENEWAL processes only. Every query goes through
 * `orgMembership`, which structurally excludes PERSON_BG and PERSON_AGREEMENT —
 * both carry `orgMembershipId: null`. `householdBgIsFresh` asks about household
 * LEADS, so answering it for an adult child's own PERSON_BG would clear their
 * check because a parent's is fresh.
 *
 * Advance only: it acts on rows whose `bgClearedAt` is null and never unstamps one.
