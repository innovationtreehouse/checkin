/**
 * Triggers that OPEN a per-person membership-agreement obligation (PERSON_AGREEMENT).
 * An 18+ child of the household lead is a legal adult and cannot be bound by their
 * parent's signature, so they sign their own agreement.
 *
 * Rules: docs/rules/membership.md. Two things diverge from personBgTriggers.ts on
 * purpose — age is judged as-of NOW (not as-of the boundary) and the trigger runs
 * NIGHTLY (not annually). Both are load-bearing; see below.
 */


/**
 * Automatic-population age rule: a DOB on file and 18–25 as of `now`.
 *
 * The band is the spouse guard. `isDeclaredAdult` means "over 25, no DOB" — set by the
 * intake checkbox and stamped by the nightly DOB purge as people cross 26. A non-lead
 * adult over 25 is a spouse the household never marked as a lead, or an adult child who
 * should have their own household by now: household hygiene, not a signature obligation.
 * A non-lead 18–25 with a DOB is a child who turned 18.
 *
 * The ceiling is explicit even though the purge makes it redundant today (a DOB implies
 * ≤25), because the implicit version has a reachable hole: a household adds a 30-year-old
 * spouse with a DOB and doesn't mark them a lead — until the next purge runs they'd qualify.
 *
 * Age is as-of `now`, NOT as-of the membership-year boundary. Boundary-relative age (what
 * personBgVerdict does) evaluated by a nightly job would flag a 17-year-old whose 18th
 * birthday merely falls before the next boundary — asking a minor to sign a contract they
 * can't be bound by, the exact failure this feature exists to prevent.
 *
 * `now` is an instant, so the age is judged on the calendar day it falls on in the org's
 * zone: the band opens at local midnight, not at 7 PM the evening before.
