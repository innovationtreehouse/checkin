/**
 * Annual renewal. A common membership-year boundary (BoardSettings) drives every

 * and reminds the household — the membership stays ACTIVE throughout.
 *
 * When the member begins renewal they enter the SAME external step a new applicant
 * gets (PENDING_EXTERNAL_ACTION): a fresh membership agreement is signed EVERY
 * cycle, and the background-check rule decides the other half — if EITHER parent's
 * background check is still valid at the boundary (lastBackgroundCheck within
 * BoardSettings.bgRecheckMonths of it, board-configured), bgClearedAt is stamped
 * and signing alone opens payment; otherwise the member requests a new background
 * check on Averity and the 2-of-N review runs in parallel with payment, exactly
 * like INITIAL. No auto-revoke — manual admin action. RENEWAL_PENDING_BG is legacy:
 * nothing writes it anymore (a migration moved open rows to the request flow).
