/**
 * OrgMembershipProcess lifecycle — ONE declarative definition (Phase 2b).
 *
 * See docs/designs/LIFECYCLE.md. This module instances the
 * dependency-free primitives in `@/lib/lifecycle` for the membership machine:
 * the states, the transition-set predicates (as StateSets that emit BOTH a
 * client-safe `has` and a server Prisma `where` from one source), the
 * transition table, and classify/validate. It is a DEFINITION layer only — it
 * never executes a transition. Postgres stays the runtime authority; every
 * `FOR UPDATE` lock, conditional `updateMany`, and partial-unique-index +
 * P2002 catch is unchanged and merely *fed* the status set it names.
 *
 * Client-safe — pages import this file, and a Prisma value here would pull the
 * generated client into a page bundle. `no-restricted-imports` in
 * `eslint.config.mjs` allows `@/generated/prisma` only as `import type`.
 * Predicates therefore take booleans, not `Date | null`; the `where` fragments
 * are plain object literals typed via the generic; enum parity is compile-time
 * here and value-based only in the test.
