/**
 * Loader for the static membership-agreement PDF that gets uploaded to Zoho Sign.
 * We do NOT generate the PDF — Zoho overlays the signature fields onto this file
 * (Printed Name prefilled). Reads the last-page index + dimensions the way the
 * source-of-truth script used pymupdf, but via pdf-lib (pure JS).
 *
 * The PDF is NOT committed to the repo: it lives in a private S3 bucket and is
 * fetched here at runtime with the ECS task role (region + credentials come from
 * the environment — no static creds in the image). One bucket/key serves every
 * env; non-prod signatures are watermarked at upload time (see stampWatermark).
 *
 * TODO(#289): upload the real agreement to s3://$AGREEMENT_PDF_S3_BUCKET/
 * $AGREEMENT_PDF_S3_KEY once https://github.com/innovationtreehouse/checkin/
 * issues/289 closes. Until the bucket is configured / the object exists,
 * loadAgreementPdf() throws AgreementUnavailableError (the sign endpoint then
 * reports a clean 503) rather than uploading a placeholder.
