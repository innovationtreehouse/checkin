/**
 * Activate paid program enrollments — the single choke point the Shopify
 * orders/paid webhook AND the reconciler both call (mirrors membership's
 * activate()). Extracted from the webhook route so a MISSED webhook can be
 * recovered by the reconciler through the exact same, idempotent path.
 *
 * Per participant: a transactionally-guarded PENDING → ACTIVE flip (so a webhook
 * redelivery or a reconciler re-run can't double-activate or double-count),
 * clearing the pending timer, stamping the paying order id, and releasing any
 * scholarship inventory hold (compensating Shopify's sale-time auto-decrement).
 *
 * The membership-item check lives with the CALLER, because only the webhook has
 * the order's line-item variant ids — the mirror does not. The webhook passes the
 * computed value; the reconciler passes hasProgramItem=true (it matched the order
 * to a pending enrollment by email).
