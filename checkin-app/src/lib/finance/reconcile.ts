/**
 * Shopify payment reconciler. Reads the s-read `shopify_read` mirror and aligns
 * Shopify order truth with membership/program truth, both directions:
 *
 *   forward  — a paid order whose family is still stuck at PENDING_PAYMENT is a
 *              MISSED orders/paid webhook: recover it (activate), advancing the
 *              family past the paid checkpoint. Application AND renewal.
 *   reversal — an order we already activated on that is later refunded, charged
 *              back, or cancelled: raise a PaymentException for the board. We never
 *              auto-revert access (a chargeback can be a bank error).
 *
 * Runs once daily from api/cron/reconcile-shopify (09:15 UTC, just behind s-read's
 * 09:00 sync — the cadence is a scale-to-zero constraint, see that route).
 * Idempotent: forward recovery is a no-op once activate() has recorded the order
 * (activate stores shopifyOrderId and short-circuits on paidAt), and every
 * exception upserts on (kind, order).
 *
 * Matching uses the SAME cart attribute the webhook credits — Membership_Process_ID
 * (or CheckMeIn_Account_ID + Program_ID), mirrored since #1029 — so attribution is
 * exact. Orders synced before that carry no attributes and fall back to customer
 * email → household lead → the family's single pending process.
 *
 * Membership recovery replicates the webhook's variant-id check that the order
 * really contains the membership product: the mirror's order lines carry variant
 * ids since #1048, so recovery gates on the order containing one of checkin's known
 * membership variants — the exact set the webhook builds — not on order total.
 * (Orders synced before #1048 and not yet backfilled carry no line variant ids;
 * those fall back to a discount-aware dues amount gate — see reconcileForwardMembership.)
 * Nothing is guessed: an attribute naming an unknown process, an ambiguous email
 * match, or an order with no membership item raises a problem for the board rather
 * than activating. One policy check rides on top of the variant gate: a
 * non-volunteer family redeeming the board's volunteer discount code raises
 * DISCOUNT_UNAUTHORIZED instead of activating (see usesVolunteerCodeUnentitled).
 *
 * The program side carries the parallel check: a minted `PRG{programId}-XXXXXXXX`
 * member-discount code (see mintMemberDiscountCode in lib/shopify.ts) redeemed by a
 * household that isn't dues-settled through the program's coverage date raises the
 * same DISCOUNT_UNAUTHORIZED — the forward pass raises it instead of activating; the
 * reversal audit raises it for the board while leaving the enrollment ACTIVE (see
 * usesProgramMemberCode). Same never-auto-revert posture as every other reversal.
