//
// We cast the extended client back to PrismaClient for the exported type. A
// $extends() result is a runtime superset but a DIFFERENT static type (it drops
// $on and re-parameterizes $transaction/TransactionClient), so leaking it into
// `ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>` would break every consumer typed
// against PrismaClient / Prisma.TransactionClient / DbClient. The person.* API
// is identical either way, so the cast hides nothing consumers use.
// The aurora-resume-retry extension (outermost, so it wraps everything) rides
// out the shared cluster's ~30s auto-pause resume instead of surfacing P1001
// as a generic 500 — see lib/auroraResumeRetry.ts and components/DbWakeNotice.tsx.
