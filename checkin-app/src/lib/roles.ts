 *  - the last-board-member guard: board membership can never be revoked down
 *    to zero, regardless of actor (including "system" — this protects data
 *    integrity, not authority, so the bypass above does not extend to it).
 *  - the denied-household guard: BOARD can't be granted to a member of a DENIED
 *    household, the mirror of the deny-side refusal in
 *    POST /api/membership-ops/households. Also actor-independent.
 *
 * Every writer that mutates a role — the PATCH /api/roles route, bootstrap

 * accidentally skip any of them.
 *
 * Locks the whole BOARD row set FOR UPDATE before checking or writing.
 * ponytail: FOR UPDATE over the whole set — tiny table (a handful of rows),
 * so a coarse lock is fine; per-row locking buys nothing at this scale. This
 * serializes concurrent board-removals so two txns can't each drop a
 * different board member down to zero. Re-acquiring the lock on rows this
 * same transaction already holds is a no-op, so calling this more than once
 * per request (one delta field at a time) is safe.
 *
 * A no-op (flag already at `on`, per the under-lock read) returns
 * `{changed:false}` after taking the lock but without writing or auditing.
