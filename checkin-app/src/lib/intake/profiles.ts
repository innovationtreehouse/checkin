/**
 * Intake field profiles — one declarative source of truth for "which fields
 * each intake context shows / requires."
 *
 * Four surfaces (membership intake, public program register, household add,
 * household edit) each hand-rolled their own field list + required-ness and
 * drifted apart (allergies present in edit paths but not create; parent phone
 * required in one, absent in another). A profile keyed by context fixes that:
 * adding/renaming a field is a one-line edit every surface inherits.
 *
 * Field keys stay aligned with the intake form keys used by IntakeError.fields
 * ("address", "emergencyContact", "primaryName") so the client can highlight
 * the offending inputs unchanged.
 *
 * See docs/designs/auth-first-registration.md §9.3.
