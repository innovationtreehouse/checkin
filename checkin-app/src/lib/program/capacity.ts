 * (cron/pending-participants), and grace-period auto-withdrawal
 * (cron/scholarship-grace-expiry) — so the hold-ledger invariant (every

 * three.
 *
 * `delete()` IS the atomicity boundary: a given row can be deleted at most
 * once, so "was inventoryHeldAt set on the row we just deleted" can never be
 * double-counted even under concurrent callers — a second delete() throws
 * Prisma P2025 (row already gone), which callers handle as an idempotent
 * no-op and never reach this function for.
 *
 * Never throws on the Shopify leg (adjustProgramInventory already logs +
 * emails on failure); the boolean return lets the caller surface a
 * non-fatal warning the same way every other Shopify-adjusting endpoint does.
