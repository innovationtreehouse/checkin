 * Resolve who the actor may write visits for on the self-service surface
 * (design 1256_ATTENDANCE_CORRECTION_SURFACE.md §1/§3): themselves always, and
 * — for a household lead — any member of their OWN household. The lead is the
 * responsible adult, so acting for a household member is self-equivalent; this
 * is the only way a minor's visit can be corrected at all.
 *
 * The scope comes from the server (the actor's own householdId), never from the
 * request: a subjectId off the body is only ever a target to check against it.
 * Returns null when the actor has no such claim — the caller turns that into a
 * 403 (an explicit target) or a 404 (a target reached through a visit id).
