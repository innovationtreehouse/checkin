/**
 * Exhaustive state-space safety proof.
 *
 * For each machine, enumerate the ENTIRE bounded state space — every
 * (status × flag-combination) tuple — and assert:
 *   1. on-diagram ⟹ clean:      classify(row) ≠ null  ⟹  validate(row) == null
 *   2. off-diagram ⟹ flagged:   classify(row) == null ⟹  validate(row) ≠ null
 *      (so `validate` totally detects every off-diagram tuple — the reconciler's oracle)
 *   3. no legal path escapes:    every classifiable state is a node the transition
 *      graph can actually reach (bfsStates), and every reachable node is realized
 *      by some tuple — no orphan diagram nodes, no reachable-but-off-diagram states.
 *
 * This is model-checking without TLA+/Alloy: the space is a few hundred tuples,
 * so one dependency-free test proves no sequence of legal transitions reaches a
 * bad state. Pure — no DB, no Prisma value import.
