/**
 * Detection (read-only) of duplicate / overlapping attendance Visit rows.
 *
 * Duplicates arise because /api/events/[id]/attendance validates attendance
 * inside a $transaction with NO per-participant advisory lock (unlike /api/scan
 * and /api/attendance/manual, which take pg_advisory_xact_lock). Two leads
 * validating the same event concurrently — or a validation racing a live kiosk
 * scan — can each miss the other's row and both create a Visit for the same
 * participant over the same window.
 *
 * This module ONLY surfaces those overlaps so a lead can resolve them by hand.
 * It adds no constraint, lock, or write-path change (a prevention layer was
 * considered and rejected as disproportionate — severity is an inflated event
 * present-count, which is reversible and human-visible).
 *
 * A Visit interval is half-open: [arrivedAt, departedAt). departedAt = null is an
 * OPEN visit, treated as [arrivedAt, +infinity). Intervals that merely touch at a
 * boundary (one ends exactly when the next begins) do NOT overlap — that's a
 * legitimate back-to-back visit. Disjoint intervals (leave and come back) are
 * also legitimate and never flagged.
 */

 * human resolving the pile-up wants to see together.
 *
 * ponytail: O(n log n) sweep; a participant has a handful of visits, never enough
