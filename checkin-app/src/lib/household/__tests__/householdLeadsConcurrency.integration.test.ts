/**
 * Direct integration test for addHouseholdLead — the atomic household-lead cap
 * enforcer (issue #269).
 *
 * The function counts existing leads then creates, under a Household-row
 * FOR UPDATE lock taken first, so two concurrent promotions for the last slot
 * serialize: the second blocks on the lock, then sees the bumped count and is
 * rejected. Read Committed alone would let both count N and both insert,
 * overfilling past MAX_HOUSEHOLD_LEADS — only the explicit lock closes that
 * TOCTOU race. It's also idempotent (re-adding an existing lead is a no-op that
 * does NOT count against the cap) and dispatches between the prisma singleton
 * (opens its own tx) and an existing tx client (joins it).
 *
 * Production exercises this only transitively via the import + lead routes;
 * nothing hits the race the lock exists for directly. This suite does.
 *
 * (jest.setup.js gives this suite TEST_DB_POOL_MAX=2 so the two transactions
 * run on separate connections; the FOR UPDATE lock is then the only thing
 * serializing them, as in production.)
