 * Households to chase on the membership audit / nav badge:

 *      with Google yet (a claimed lead covers the whole household).
 *   2. Broken: no lead at all — no email requirement (may have no contactable member).
 * The audit list route and the nav count MUST use this same predicate or they drift.
 *
 * "Signed in" is the Account row, NOT `Person.googleId`. googleId is only written on
 * the new-user path (auth-options createUser, off the Google profile); an imported
 * Person matched by email links via allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking, which writes
 * only an Account and never backfills googleId. Keying off googleId therefore left
 * every imported household — exactly the population this list chases — permanently
 * unclaimed no matter how many times its lead signed in. Account covers both paths
 * (createUser is followed by linkAccount) and survives a participant merge, which
 * reassigns Account.userId unconditionally while googleId only moves if the conflict
 * picker chose it.
