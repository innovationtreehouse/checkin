/**
 * Flow test for the membership post-payment activation fan-out.
 *
 * Drives the full applicant journey over HTTP against a running dev server with a
 * fresh seed, all the way to an ACTIVE household membership, and proves the two
 * things activation must do end-to-end:
 *   1. The membership + its process both reach ACTIVE (not parked at
 *      PENDING_PAYMENT / PENDING_BG_CLEARANCE).
 *   2. Exactly ONE "congrats, your membership is active" email is sent to the
 *      household lead — never zero (activation silently stopped) and never two
 *      (double fan-out). payment.ts › activate() calls sendCongrats exactly once,
 *      on the single INACTIVE→ACTIVE transition.
 *
 * The pay step fires the REAL inbound Shopify orders/paid webhook via the local
 * dev stand-in (/api/dev/shopify/orders-paid → activateByProcessId, payment.ts:240),
 * so this exercises the exact production activation path, HMAC-verify included.
 *
 * To reach ACTIVE the moment payment lands, the background check must already be
 * cleared: intake → external actions → two distinct reviewers approve (clears BG,
 * holds at PENDING_PAYMENT) → pay → ACTIVE.
 *
 * Persona / isolation note: uses parent.family (household1) as the applicant. Only two
 * seeded personas are household leads (parent.family, parent.family2) and BOTH are already
 * claimed by sibling flow tests (membership-self-attest uses parent.family; membership-
 * bg-nonblocking uses parent.family2). Those siblings coexist only because neither drives
 * its household to a terminal ACTIVE membership — this test does, and an ACTIVE household
 * makes startIntake reject the next application with 409 already_member. So this test
 * resets its applicant's household back to the pristine no-membership state (see
 * resetApplicantHousehold) both before it runs (order-independence) and in afterAll (so a
 * sibling that runs next sees a clean household). The reset is scoped by lead email and
 * touches only that household; the flow runner is --runInBand, so each file's afterAll
 * completes before the next file starts.
 *
 * Emails are captured to the DevSentEmail table (no RESEND_API_KEY in the flow env,
 * so sendEmail records instead of delivering) and asserted straight off that table.
 * (Scraping the /dev/sent-mail HTML page is not a usable oracle: one email row renders
 * 2–3 times across the SSR DOM + the RSC Flight payload, so an occurrence count can't
 * tell one send from a double.) The table is cleared at the top so the count is
 * deterministic and re-run-safe.
 *
 * DB access note: flow tests normally talk HTTP only. This one reads the capture table
 * directly with a raw `pg` pool — NOT the prisma client, whose Prisma-7 WASM query
 * compiler is ESM the flow jest config can't load. It needs DATABASE_URL, which the
 * standalone runner (docker-compose.flow.yml) sets; against a hand-started server,
 * export the same DATABASE_URL in the shell running jest.
 *
 * The OTHER fan-out items an activation could eventually trigger — mailing-list add,
 * badge-print queue, and the 18+ background-check trigger — do NOT exist yet and are
 * deliberately NOT asserted here (tracked as Q4/Q6/Q7). Add assertions when they land.
