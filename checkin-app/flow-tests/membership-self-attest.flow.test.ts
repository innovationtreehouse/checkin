/**
 * Flow test for applicant-self-attested background-check consent (#875).
 *
 * The consent step used to be board-gated: after clicking through to Averity the
 * applicant waited for a board member to notice Averity's email and human-mark
 * bgConsentAt before payment opened. Now the applicant self-attests ("I submitted
 * my consent on Averity") through POST /api/membership/bg-consent, and — once the
 * contract is signed — advances to PENDING_PAYMENT with no board action in the
 * middle of the sitting. The board's mark-bg-consent remains a backstop; the
 * two-reviewer check still runs in parallel with payment (PR #428).
 *
 * Assumes a freshly-seeded DB (parent.family is a non-member household lead; the
 * bg-nonblocking flow test uses the separate parent.family2 household).
