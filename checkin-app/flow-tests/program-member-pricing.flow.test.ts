 * Flow test for the single-pool member-pricing journey: board creates a priced
 * program, a member and a non-member each probe the discount-code route, the
 * member self-enrolls, and paying (via the dev Shopify orders/paid stand-in)
 * activates their enrollment. Exercises program creation → discount-code →
 * enroll → pay as a whole HTTP journey, wired through real auth, routes, and DB.
 *
 * Personas: boardmember@example.com (board, creates the program),
 * member.pricing@example.com (dues-settled household lead — ACTIVE OrgMembership
 * from the seed), and certified.adult@example.com (solo household, no
 * OrgMembership row — a genuine non-member, used read-only here).
