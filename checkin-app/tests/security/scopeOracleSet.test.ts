/**
 * The scope oracles under src/security/__tests__/ are the per-model assertions
 * of what each role may see. Nothing else pins that they exist.
 *
 * security-boundary-isolation.yml deliberately does NOT treat them as boundary
 * files — a decommission has to update its own oracle, and classifying them as
 * boundary made the exception refuse the shape it exists for. That is the right
 * call, and it costs the one mechanical guard those files had: an oracle can now
 * ride along inside an ordinary feature PR, and a deleted test is invisible to a
 * green run. CODEOWNERS still forces a security owner onto the review, but that
 * is a human reading a large diff, which is the failure isolation exists to stop.
 *
 * So the set is pinned here. Adding an oracle costs one line and makes a
 * reviewer see the new file; removing one has to be written down on purpose.
 *
 * This file cannot pin itself — a deleted test cannot fail — so its own
 * existence is asserted by security-boundary-isolation.yml, which runs on every
 * PR into main whether or not the Jest suite does.
