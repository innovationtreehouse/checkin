/**
 * PrismaClient singleton for the global-catalog database (Postgres via @prisma/adapter-pg).
 *
 * Construction is **lazy**: the URL is read and the client built on first use, not at
 * import. This lets the test harness set CATALOG_DATABASE_URL after this module loads,
 * and means importing `@/db` (which every route does) never connects or throws merely because
 * a URL is absent — important for `next build`, which loads route modules with no database.
 * The env-read wiring is guarded against drift by db-client-construction.test.ts.
 *
 * Prisma 7 is Rust-free: the client connects through a driver adapter rather than reading
 * `datasource.url` itself. In production CATALOG_DATABASE_URL should route through RDS
 * Proxy / pgBouncer (`?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1`).
