/**
 * Push-based service freshness — the inversion of the watchdog's old pull probe (F7).
 *
 * The old model had the watchdog hold a Postgres connection string to EVERY watched
 * service's financial database and read `sync_run` directly. That made the monitor the
 * highest-value target in the fleet (one compromise → all DB credentials) while being the
 * most widely-copied, dependency-light component.
 *
 * In the push model each service writes its own freshness into THIS dedicated monitoring DB
 * (which holds no financial/PII data) via `recordHeartbeat`, and the watchdog reads it back
 * via `readServiceHeartbeats`. The watchdog therefore needs no credential to any service's
 * own database — its blast radius is the monitoring DB alone.
 *
 * Why two timestamps instead of one: the watchdog distinguishes STALE (no recent success)
 * from ERRORING (a failure newer than the last success). Those need the last success and
 * the last failure independently — exactly the two queries the old probe ran — so we keep
 * them in separate columns and advance each on its own terminal transition.
