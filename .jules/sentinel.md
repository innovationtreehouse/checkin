## 2024-05-24 - [Timing Attack in Webhook Verification]
**Vulnerability:** Found a timing attack vulnerability in `src/app/api/webhooks/shopify/route.ts` where the HMAC signature from Shopify (`headerSignature`) was being compared to the expected signature (`generatedSignature`) using a standard string equality operator (`!==`).
**Learning:** Standard string comparisons fail early as soon as a mismatching character is found. This "fail-fast" behavior leaks timing information to an attacker, theoretically allowing them to guess the correct HMAC character by character and forge a valid Shopify webhook signature to bypass payment verification.
**Prevention:** Always use `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` when comparing security-sensitive signatures, hashes, or tokens. Both values must be converted to `Buffer` objects of the exact same length before comparison to ensure constant-time execution regardless of where the mismatch occurs.

## 2024-05-24 - React CSS Injection Vulnerability
**Vulnerability:** Used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to inject CSS dynamically in React components (`src/components/ContentWrapper.tsx`).
**Learning:** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` can open up possibilities for XSS, even if it's currently injecting a static or semi-static string. It bypasses React's built-in escaping mechanisms. The project explicitly avoids using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for CSS injection in React components, favoring global CSS rules and class toggling on root elements like `body` (from memory).
**Prevention:** Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary. Use CSS classes or inline styles with React's `style` prop instead. For global styles, toggle a class on a root element (like `body`) using a `useEffect` hook.

## 2025-02-14 - Enforce environment check for dev auth feature flags
**Vulnerability:** Development authentication endpoints and UI (DevLoginPicker) could be exposed in production if the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTH` feature flag was mistakenly set.
**Learning:** Feature flags alone are not sufficient protection for development/debug features, especially those that mock authentication.
**Prevention:** Always pair development feature flags with a strict `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` check to create an unbreakable safety net.
